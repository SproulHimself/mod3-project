Today, many people cannot be in a room on their own with their own thoughts for longer than one minute before they have to look at their social media accounts. Humans are now relative to drones in the hive mind, where they follow engineered thought patterns globally and are affected in concert by events and trend influencers. The goal of social media is to give people quick fixes, rewards, to enslave them in a box where their every thought is echoed, where their narcissism can truly take effect. By encapsulating humans within this simplistic form of communication, the social media companies are able to extract vast amounts of information to not only profit from, but to analyse human behaviour in multiple conditions. Social media has engineered a system where complex human behaviour is whittled to nothing more than a few words. This is the crux of the programming of humans to completely disable their true abilities and dumb them down to mere childish animal behaviour. The incessant chatter of social media also overtakes the human thought process, and people are now not able to think for themselves without going to social media. Their rational thought processes have been dimmed, or completely erased. There is little or no benefit to this, especially for children as they cannot progress as adult human beings, and for adults who use social media, they are reverting to childhood, with petty reward systems and the innate inability to form real social relationships face to face. Social media was designed to entrap, to subvert humans, and to damage society as a whole, and it is working very well. Selfies Amongst the megalomaniacs, narcissists, sociopaths, and the schizoids that now populate the world of social media, there is a terrible price being paid on humanity, as these people have been permanently altered, their brains now do not function without social media, they are now less tolerant, they are effective psychotics who delete humans in their social network with a blink of an eye, or a mouse click. What these social networks are engineering is a population of cold hearted killers, because if they can simply delete someone from their social network, what will stop them deleting people in real life? Nothing will stop them, as their minds have been trained and engineered to do so. Thus social media is creating a mass engineered swathe of nihilistic humans with no conscience or ability to empathise in a human manner. There is no given solution to the horror of social media, a prison of the mind where free thought is punished, and anyone who dissents from the indoctrinated hive mind is immediately set upon by mobs of social media thugs intent on hurt. We are now seeing this today, where the introduction of terms like ‘fake news’, and ‘hate speech’ are used as an Orwellian tool to subvert any form of free speech. All it takes is a group of internet thugs to report your account and your finished, there are no questions asked, and the mob is always right in the eyes of the algorithm. If you have children, keep them away from social media. Let them grow as human beings who can think rationally, logically and without the need for constant rewards. We must teach children logical thought processes and educate them in classical methods of thought, yet keep a modern slant on education in a scientific way, as well as culturally with high art. Anyone who uses social media today has been sadly infected to a point where it will be very hard to ever regain their rational selves, and souls back again. Such is the malaise that whole generations, and swathes of humans have now been lost. To destroy these people is now only too easy, all it would take is a switch off, and they would suddenly realise how lost they are. Switching everything off would culminate in a mass population psychotic event. Those who are awake will understand, however those who are hypnotised by social media are a lost cause, and should be deemed as completely useless human beings.'], ['Coursework Writing', 'C oursework is an academic assignment given to students with the aim to enhance their knowledge and research skills, demonstrate their research and analytical skills.

Everyday there is a massive influx of people from some of the poorest nations in the world. It is the EU’s job to accept these people and to house and feed them. “The EU is responsible for the wellbeing of migrants from all over the world, and should accept these human beings as their own. “Mass migration is a definite improvement to the EU population which is declining and is a predominantly ageing statistic. “The migrants crossing the ocean into the EU perilously should be commended for their bravery and their hope of finding a better way of life for them, their children and extended families. We must all come together as one human race, and these are the tenets of the EU, as one single union. “Statistics and research show that in the summer of 2018, at least 500,000 migrants are making their way into Spain and Southern Italy. The EU should aim higher, and more migration numbers should be accepted.” Please support more migration into the EU and the dedicated teams of people helping more migrants to make their dreams come true.

With major currencies from time zones around the world available to be traded, the forex market is open for business pretty much all the time during the week – which makes it particularly appealing for those who are on flexible schedules. But it does come with its complications. There are some big technical complexities to get your head around before you can successfully trade the forex markets, and it’s also unpredictable. Here, then, are some ways to prepare yourself to enter the market and then get cracking with your first forex trade. What is foreign exchange? Before you even begin to look for a broker, it’s important to spend as much time as you need working out what the forex market is all about. There are many reasons why foreign currencies are bought and sold, and the main one with which most people are familiar is the exchange of currencies for tourist or business travel purposes when heading to a foreign country. But there are other possible reasons. Forex traders buy up currency for speculative reasons – which means they aim to sell it on at a higher price than the one they bought it for, thus making a profit. Others buy foreign currency to “hedge”, or to have an asset which protects them in case the market moves in a direction which harms their existing interests. Understanding the fundamentals Forex trading instruments differ in appearance and structure from most other offers on the investment market, which means that those who diversify their trading portfolio from stocks and shares or similar instruments often find forex a difficult beast at first. Currencies are, for example, always traded in pairs: if you want to trade the US dollar, say, you’ll have to speculate on its rise relative to another currency. Currencies are represented in three-letter codes, such as USD for the dollar, GBP for the British pound, and so on. The two currencies in question are separated by a slash, and the first currency in the pair is the one you’re hoping will rise. So, if you want to speculate that the US dollar will go up in value compared to the Japanese yen, for example, you’d need to invest in the USD/JPY pair. There’s much more to forex trading than that, though, and this explanation can only scratch the surface of the foreign exchange market. There are plenty of books and online resources which offer advice on Forex trading for Beginners, and reading these will give you a comprehensive understanding of how this complicated yet often lucrative market works and what it means for a trader. Find a calendar International economic calendars are absolutely essential tools which should be in the arsenal of every forex trader – perhaps more so than any other financial trading instrument. They come full of important information which traders will need to execute orders in an informed manner, so they’re vital. When a country’s central bank updates its monetary policy for example, the forex market can shift in minutes – and you need to ensure that you’re aware of when these developments are happening so that you can price the potential changes into your trading decision. Luckily, the calendars are relatively easy to find online – and they’re usually free. Choosing an instrument type In the modern trading world, it’s increasingly common for traders to choose contracts for difference – or CFDs – when trading foreign exchange. These instruments are derived from the underlying market, which means the trader doesn’t actually own the currency. However, they benefit – and lose out – from the same market fluctuations as the “real” currency, and they can usually also access the market much faster as CFD brokers are speedy and online-oriented. Forex CFDs can also offer higher profits (and losses) for lower initial deposits as they’re traded on margin – which essentially means the trader is borrowing the remainder of the required deposit from the broker whenever they open a position. Some traders (or clients of traders) prefer to purchase the actual currency itself, and this may be more appropriate if margin trading is not required. Working as a forex trader can be a tough gig, especially once the unpredictability and the complex fundamental principles are taken into account. And with other challenges like integration of accurate economic information into calendars to think about, forex trading can quickly become a hard job. That’s why information calendars, effective instrument type decisions and more should all be taken seriously. That way, the chances of your trading career getting off to the most successful and profitable start will be as high as possible.'], ['Sunseekers Going to Desperate Lengths to Get Prime Spot on Beaches', 'Sunseekers who religiously seek the prime spot of the beaches, and sun beds, are going to extraordinary lengths to make their summer holidays truly wondrous. Forget about German holidaymakers placing their towels on sun beds at 3am to get the best spots for the next day, a new trend is even more extreme. “These sunseekers storm the beach and get the sun beds before anyone can even bat an eyelid. It’s like the storming of Normandy beach, except in Spain,” one angry tourist said who had to sit on a rock after the prime beach areas were taken. The alarming trend is now a frequent occurrence across the whole of Spain’s coast. Miguel Conquistador, 49, from Alicante, was shocked when he was about to place his beach towel on the sand in a prime spot from the sea when he was affected by the phenomenon. “I was just about to place my towel on the sand, when suddenly out of the sea a group of sunseekers suddenly landed their boat and rushed towards me. In a matter of seconds, my towel had been kicked away and 67 people were sitting in my spot.” These sudden landings by sunseekers is actually great news for Spain, and should be encouraged to the full. Not migrants “These are sunseekers on their summer holidays, and not migrants. It’s a beautiful sight to see people who are dedicated to the beach life taking so much care and attention to their summer holidays. We invite them to Spain, please come, enjoy our beaches, our wine, our women. You are all welcome,” Spain’s Interior Minister, Rodriguez Schengenado, told Spanish news networks on Tuesday.'], ['The Semantics of Anti-Semitism and Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn', 'In the words of a great rock band, Kiss, who were mainly Jewish, ‘Everybody’s gotta reason to live’, something, maybe Jeremy Corbyn does not believe to be true. The right to life, to self determination, is a hard fought right, and certainly the state of Israel has fought tooth and nail to survive for so long. History is about conquest, and the Jewish state has as much right to exist as any other state in the world. With regards to anyone criticising Israel as being deemed as anti-semitic, this is another hard paradoxical line in the sand that Jeremy Corbyn has brought to the fore. In rational discussion, it may be okay to criticise a state’s specific actions, however one should not criticise the state’s reason to exist. All Jewish people have a right to exist as much as any other, and this is the crux of the problem for Corbyn, because he is siding with the likes of Hamas, who do not believe that Israel has a right to exist and all Jews should just keel over and die. That stance, is anti-semitic and Corbyn knows it full well. No one should ever forget the holocaust and all the other atrocities meted out on Jews throughout history, and for this, it is their right to fight anti-semitism at every turn. Today, atrocities are committed by all global factions, and indeed Israel has come down hard on those who sought to attack their state, and in desperation, the Palestinians have committed many atrocities fighting those who they blame for their misfortune. One must again look at history, invention, ingenuity, technique always wins through, and the Jews have always been at the forefront of all of these points. The Palestinians never broke through, they never innovated, they never chose the path of ingenuity or technical excellence. Jeremy Corbyn, is now walking a very dangerous tightrope from which he has possibly tainted the whole Labour party for many years to come. Alienating a very important population strand in Britain and indeed the world, it is only a matter of time before something gives and he loses his grip on the party completely. Does Jeremy Corbyn have the right to exist?'], ['Ordering Up a Can of Whoop Ass at McDonalds', 'There’s something about McDonalds which brings forth the beast in the great unwashed masses. Not only does the fast food restaurant feed the people with their daily mush, it is a conduit for extreme violence, most of the time highly entertaining gladiatorial combat that ends up on YouTube. Over the years the restaurant has tried to clean up its image, and has refurbished their restaurants to try to appeal to a better clientele, however this has mostly failed because the food they serve only applies itself to the lowest common denominator. Processed shit for the Untermensch is a big money maker, and there will never be any escape for the company in this respect. The only solution obviously is to put armed guards in every restaurant outlet. This way, when the ratchets start their screeching and hair pulling, and the gang boys start their fist fights, there could be a lot of tomato ketchup splattered all over the walls as the armed guards let loose. McDonalds employees beating customers with their fists, although entertaining, is less effective than guns. Amongst the wreckage, the discarded hair weaves, the ripped thongs, the McDonalds sign shines down from above, an unholy reminder that in satan’s kitchen, money is made despite the brutal violence. Business carries on as they mop up the shit and the blood from the floor and walls. Cha ching!'], ['Trump Would Have Sealed Brexit Deal in One Hour', 'The shameful British have forgotten how to rule themselves, they have been slaves for so long to Brussels. Theresa May, the current PM, is an insipid scrawny grey pustule who could not make a deal with a paper bag let alone a coterie of unelected officials from the EU. Watching the inspiring speech by Trump on Thursday regarding the reintroduction of manufacturing of steel back into the USA was a momentous moment for many workers who have been bypassed by the likes of Obama who favoured communist China over American workers. Trump, much to the chagrin of the American socialists is actually making a difference to many peoples’ lives. Trump’s earlier meeting with Juncker sealed further trade concessions from the EU, in just a few hours of talks. Something the timid, listless British cannot do as they cower in the corner scared to even utter a word to their EU masters. Britain indeed is a country enslaved for so long it has a case of Stockholm Syndrome. If the British had an ounce of the balls that Trump has we would have been out of the EU prison a long time ago, instead Britain kowtows to every Brussels demand and is left in a shameful imbroglio, as the likes of Michel Barnier tighten their octopus grip over the imprisoned country. Britain, infected by the treachery of Remoaners, people who actively seek to do harm to the country by sabotaging every attempt to leave the EU protectionist racket, and its totalitarian Sovietized ideology are a testament that there are many Marxists within the British Isles. One day hopefully they will be rooted out and made to pay for their crimes. Can’t we hire Trump for at least one hour to go at it at the EU? He would no doubt stride into the meeting, slap something on the table, then say take it or leave it. The EU would capitulate or be thrown into total disarray. This is how Trump would negotiate with the EU, who are using Britain’s cowardice and negativity to great effect. Apart from a few Brexiteers in parliament, no one has any balls anymore. Even the grandchild of Churchill, the bloated cochon Soames has been paid off by the EU and would sell off Britain at the drop of a hat. How ironic that Soames is now a Haw Haw. Winston Churchill most certainly did not give him any balls down the line, as he waddles around the Commons floor like a fat cheap whore on the take. That spinning sound you hear when Soames speaks is the sound of his grandfather in his grave. Winston Churchill’s vision of the EU was one led by Britain and France, and not Germany, and this is the crux of the matter. Whilst Britain was a member of the EU it had no say, and no power. If no one steps up soon to delete Theresa May, and her Remoaners, all will be lost. All hope, all chance of freedom, all national pride, but it seems that Britain had little or no national pride anyway. Please Mr. Trump come and save Britain, as the Americans saved Britain in World War II.'], ['Facebook Stock Down 25%: How Heavy Handed Censorship Killed Off Socialist Tech Companies', 'What could you do with more than $125 billion? A lot, you say. Well, $125 billion just disappeared off Facebook’s value in a few minutes after its QE2 earnings came through and a new censorship drive was pushed through. Much of the loss for these FANG stocks will be the precursor for more falls as time goes by, because investors have been hit hard with the fall. No one with a brain or a wallet wants to touch these stocks, simply because of the climate we are in now. On the bright side, at least Zuckerberg burned a new U.S record. The one day drop of Facebook was the highest stock market single day loss in known American history. Socialists are meant to be inclusive This climate is an Orwellian deluge of mass censorship, mass deletions, and un-inclusivity. What the socialists who run these tech media companies do not realise is that they are censoring the spice that made their boring formats exciting. Anyone with an education and logical thought process can see if a post is rather iffy or outrageous, but they watch the videos for entertainment purposes. There is no need to censor something purely because it does not conform to socialist political ideals. There has been mass censorship of all conservative views on these platforms, there has also been shadow-banning, and mass deletions of accounts that did not conform to the communistic views of the controllers in charge. What we have now is a completely one-sided platform on places like YouTube and Facebook, where anything with an alternative view is labelled as ‘hate speech’ then removed. Orwellian Thoughtcrime Defining ‘hate speech’ is a difficult proposal, but much can be plonked into its allocation folder. Much like George Orwell’s 1984, we are seeing anything that does not hold the American democratic socialist party’s line of thought as ‘hate speech’. By removing the essence of discussion, of opposing views, you see a decline in conversation, a fall in debate, and thus these platforms are now merely propaganda machines for the American socialists to feed off each other as everyone else is excluded from the debate. To question something is now deemed as ‘hate crime’ because the questioning goes against the narrative or socialist conditioning that is constantly put out by the tech companies and the socialist controlled media. Censorship kills discussion, censorship kills art, and censorship kills the fundamental reason why the internet, world wide web was created. Berners-Lee surely would agree? Censoring formerly protected genres Google has even severely censored the Daily Squib, which is an essentially satirical parody news format, and in history satire/parody has only been heavily censored by totalitarian communist and fascist regimes. We can therefore surmise, that this time we are living in is one of a totalitarian regime, where even the supposedly protected genre of satire is attacked. Our YouTube channel which we stopped using, was shadow-banned years ago. There is no point in posting a video on the channel because it will not get any views anymore. We tested this by uploading one of our videos onto a new created account with a different name and it immediately received tens of thousands of views. The original video in our official account got 120 views over five years. This is the level of censorship we are dealing with, where creativity, innovation and alternative views are crushed to leave a bland landscape of ‘yes men’, a hive like culture where everyone says the same thing and thinks in the same way. Humanity never progressed much when everyone said the same thing, and everyone agreed. Fuck that! What these tech companies are essentially doing is aligning themselves with communist China and its censorship technique. Facebook is itching to get into the Chinese market, therefore they are aligning themselves with the same communist ideals as the Chinese. One can only hope that the censors bring these FANG stocks, and the rest of the fucking NASDAQ down by another 40-60%. Let us see how your censorship works then you socialist ‘inclusive’ controllers of all media.'], ['Theresa May Must Go: Arch Remainer Olly Robbins Put in Full Charge of Brexit', 'With 39 signatures already lodged by backbenchers to dump Theresa May in a vote of no confidence, May’s act of sheer stupidity and arrogance is of stripping the Brexit department of any responsibility in EU negotiations and appointing Remainer, lickspittle Olly Robbins in charge of everything. The PM cannot be trusted, as she has been proven to be a liar and deceitful snake by trying to push through the Olly Robbins penned Chequers Brino proposal. Corruption The announcement was sneaked in just minutes before Mr Raab and Mr Robbins were due to give evidence to the Commons Brexit committee and appeared to be a major snub to the new Brexit secretary who is only in his second week of the job. This move by Theresa May in effect makes Raab into a mere ‘yes man’ as he has no powers whatsoever, and will answer chiefly to Robbins. The DS is under a BREXIT war footing at the moment and will continue to urge the deliverance of Britain from this treasonous hijacking of Brexit by Remainers and the duplicitous lying Mrs May. Theresa May has to go! Any method will do, either under a bus, or the 1922 committee will suffice. If the Tories do not unseat Theresa May soon, many Conservative MPs in marginal seats will be unseated for a very long time as no one will vote for them ever again.

Berkeley gender activists are boycotting all French products and French lessons until the French rewrite their language to include multiple gender types and sexualities as well as transgender types, that fall under the Californian Gender Codex enshrined in state law in 2010 and honoured by Barack Obama himself. French Masculine and Feminine Every French noun is either masculine or feminine, and this affects how the noun is treated. One more or less has to memorise the gender of each noun, although you can often tell whether a word is masculine or feminine by looking at its ending. Masculine nouns often have the ending: aire. In French the pronouns (Le, La, Les) will depend on the gender of the noun in question. All the nouns are masculine or feminine. For masculine nouns “The” is Le, whilst for feminine nouns “The” is La. If the noun is plural then “The” becomes Les. For example : The pig = Le cochon The whore = La putain The dogs = Les chiens French Language Gender Dispute The French gender issue arose when one activist took a semester of linguistics and was shocked how the French language only catered for masculine and feminine nouns. Donny Fargotte, 23, a student activist was outraged by the exclusion of transexual nouns and verbs in the French language and its exclusivity to masculine and feminine. “This is gender fascism. We detest masculine, the word masculine itself is an attack on every gender status and should be outlawed, but to have a language that only has masculine and feminine descriptions of nouns is disgusting. I stood up in my class and shouted. I cried and cried for three days at this outrageous exclusion of all other genders. This is why we have a big problem. We are going to petition the French government to change their language.” Some of the suggestions proposed by the activists is to change (Le, La, Les) to (Ze, Zee, Zees) and that all references to masculine and feminine grammar be erased completely. On Tuesday, a Boycott French day will be held at the campus, and next week, a visiting professor from a French university will probably be met with riots.'], ['The Elite Wealthy Will Abandon You When the Time Comes', 'In today’s internet era, there are too many voices, and everyone now has an opinion. The populace are now unmanageable. In days past, everyone knew their place, and everyone stayed in their place, but today this is not the case, and for the elite this is a sure sign that the end will be messy and troublesome. The wealthy have already abandoned all hope of a future where the populace, formerly known as plebs, have a voice, and have a modicum of power. They are therefore preparing for either an engineered form of deconstruction or a sudden chaotic unravelling. They are already preparing for a post-consumerist future society ruled by scientific technocrats serviced by technological automation. The elite and wealthy have already exhausted the consumerist society and used consumers to become billionaires, however they know that this state of affairs cannot last. Most certainly, the event will be an economic eviscerating maelstrom that will lead into anarchic catastrophe with gangs roaming, mass looting, and cataclysmic death to many who are unprepared. You see, the wealthy, the elite, are prepared, they have already secured plots of land with shelters, some underground, some in very secluded spots, but these wealthy elite still have one problem, how to keep their security and manual workers loyal to them when the event happens. It will be all too easy for the security detail to band together and take over the wealthy in their luxurious bunkers. What do you do when paper money is worthless, and your security men surround you with the guns you gave them? How does one keep the loyalty of the servants during a cataclysmic event wiping out all of society economically? There are certainly no easy solutions to such a debacle, but the only real solution is for these billionaires who have never done anything with their hands, or had a manual job, to actually hold a gun themselves. Many will not be able to and will perish. The first thing that happens in a major economic disaster is that all the rich in every neighbourhood are quickly dispatched and their homes/businesses looted. The swarmiing poor are vast in numbers, and when there is no police to protect the wealthy, the rich are the first to go. When that source is depleted, the people turn on themselves. Of course there are alternatives, but the technology for robots and automated guards controlled by sophisticated AI is still in its infancy. It will take another thirty to forty years to replicate humans in their entirety, but even then there will be major flaws. The time line for such an event nears every day, simply because the populace are getting more and more uncontrollable every day. The economic system built on debt, is not built on a firm foundation, and sooner or later it will give away. The Illusion will be lost overnight, the illusion of democracy, the illusion of economic prosperity, and furthermore, the interlinked global economy will crumble in one fell swoop, purely because there are little or no ways to quarantine contagion. Already, there are brief murmurs of such an event occurring, and you will know when it happens because you will not see any police in the streets any more, no medics, no social services, and there will be no way of getting your money out of the banks. All mobile phones will cease working in an instant, as well as electricity grids, and water processing centres. In effect, there will be silence. This silence will be the starting bell for carnage, anarchy and total chaos to reign over the crumbling old system, which will be cleansed over many years of nihilistic purges. Even though this warning was written in full sight, many will not heed it, and they will carry on with their meaningless lives as slaves to their mortgages and tax slave jobs. What do people do when there is no more food in the shops, when paper money is useless, and there is no authority? The answer is they do anything to survive. Anything.

A source with knowledge of the investigation said: “The team of Russians have been identified and we have released their names after we found out who they were. We urge the public to be very cautious if they meet one of these men, do not accept any drinks from them or perfume bottles.” The suspects have been named as Vlad Putinski, Valdimir Putana, Vladimirski Putinov, Vladimirov Putinoff, and finally Vladi Puttitov. These men were last seen walking down Salisbury High Street, close to where the poisonings from nerve agent Novichok was discovered.

The Russians have key Kompromat documentation and photographic, video evidence about Trump’s past visits to Russia and what he got up to. Allegedly, the Russians have extensive footage of Trump’s visit in 2013 with numerous prostitutes urinating on a hotel bed where Obama once slept, then indulging in ‘golden showers’. Igor Federov, an observer revealed the ins and outs of the situation. “One can see the fear in Trump’s eyes as he cowers before his master. All it would take is one wave of the hand, and Trump would not only be completely disgraced, but he would no doubt be impeached and thrown to the dogs. Trump agreed to every word that Putin said denying all knowledge of U.S. electoral tampering, and in the light of the recent Novichok poisonings in the UK, he did not even mention that either. This is a classic case of Kompromat.” One Associated Press reporter, Jonathan Lemire, seeing how the president sheepishly cowered in Putin’s presence, even dared to ask Putin whether the Russians had any compromising material on Trump. Putin of course masterly denied the fact, although Trump practically sank into the podium.

'], ['Brexit is Actually Very Simple – Parliament and EU Meddling Is Not', 'Britain has been at war for some time. We are now in a Brexit war, where Britain will either sink or swim. This war is both internal and external. The concept of leaving the EU completely i.e. Brexit, is actually a very simple notion that has been muddied by Remoaners in Parliament, and the EU, who have sought to stifle every part of the process of Brexit. What Brexit initially means, and what the people voted for on June 23, 2016, is for Britain to leave the EU single market, to leave EU laws and law courts, and to leave the EU Customs Union. This can all be achieved by applying WTO rules to trade and completely cutting ties with the EU courts and laws. In effect, on Brexit, no EU law would be valid in a UK court. The myriad of EU laws that have already been incorporated into the UK would have to all eventually be looked at and amended, but this is not a matter of grave urgency as other parts of Brexit will be. Regarding the EU red herring of the Irish border, this is inconsequential. It is a matter for the EU what they do with their EU customs. It has nothing to do with Britain at all, and the UK should simply leave the EU to ponder on it. Imports and exports to the EU and world will also continue under WTO rules, and the regulatory minefield that the EU creates for everything is their problem. Many products do not actually need tariffs, so it is a question of dealing with those that do. The UK just has to acknowledge that the EU has tonnes of regulations for everything, and that is that. Let the EU over regulate and indulge in useless bureaucracy and inhibitive protectionism, where the UK will not stifle business any more. Passporting rights for City workers is also another contentious issue. This can be solved very easily by ignoring the whole issue. Most UK firms do not actually need passporting rights. London will always be the centre of the financial world simply because of its location, and its time zone. Trade deals and immigration are of course a foremost subject to include. All it would take is a team of dedicated people six months to establish new trade deals, and to take back complete control of Britain’s borders by implementing a funnelling system with regards to EU migration unless applicants have high paying jobs and means to support themselves. There would naturally have to be new migration policies written to accommodate the new rules. America and Australia are begging the UK for new trade deals, as well as the lucrative South East Asian markets. Migration is good for the UK, and the economy, however we must implement a more controlled approach as opposed to unfettered. As for the millions of EU migrants who have come to Britain and are utilising our benefits system, and are not employed or employable. They will be given a cut off period of three months to find a job or be sent back to the EU. There have also been many instances of Third World citizens buying EU citizenship from Malta. These people will all be removed forthwith and sent back to their respective countries. The UK has also been blighted by thousands of EU criminals, who when caught and imprisoned are a large taxpayer burden. Because of EU courts, these criminals were not able to be sent back to the EU. After Brexit, all EU criminals within Britain’s prison system will be returned to the EU immediately. British citizens living in the EU will have their futures on the line because the EU is a vindictive nasty player and will not afford them any clemency. They therefore have two choices, stay in their respective EU territory and apply for citizenship, or come back to the UK. It would also serve Britain to increase the number of migration centres for the numbers of people who will be processed and sent back will be many. As for the CAP, tied in with Brussels, this would all be scrapped immediately. Farming subsidies will revert to the UK government. All inhibitive EU regulations would be scrapped immediately. All fishing rights within British sea channels would be for use only by British fishermen. This would be enforced by the Royal Navy who would get extra funding and ships to patrol the fishing areas. Any illegal fishermen from the Continent would be first warned, and if they refuse, they would be arrested. All payments to Brussels will cease immediately. Britain should also not have to pay a ransom amount of £45 billion stipulated by the EU, and will refuse all payments. The EU may pursue this in their courts but this would take many years, and Britain should carry on refusing payment indefinitely. The UK government could reciprocate on any EU punishments doled out in vindictive anger by enticing worldwide corporate businesses to the UK shores with lower taxation rates, and other incentives, effectively undercutting the EU. This would make the UK into a magnet for corporations and increase business activity and entrepreneurship tenfold making the UK into a global hub of International business. As for Remoaners; who have sided with the enemy, have taken illicit payments from the EU, have constantly talked Britain down and betrayed its people, they should be tried in the courts. There is no doubt that many Remoaners in parliament are receiving large sums of money from the enemy, including the meddler George Soros, the Open Society financier, to thwart Britain’s run for Brexit freedom and International trading success. From this point we must take a military stance to proceedings as there will be many loose ends that need to be tied. The process of Brexit, if looked upon in a military fashion is very simple, and it should be treated clinically as if we are in a time of war. This war, will take a lot of patience, dedication and sheer will to win, but it is winnable, Brexit can be achieved very easily be simply removing the factors that step in its way. Once a problem factor is identified, it must be targeted, then removed, so we can move on. Brexit can be achieved quickly and effectively, but there will have to be ruthless decisions made with clinical precision and technique.

Theresa May blatantly lied not only to her own ministers misleading them, but she lied to voters and the public ever since she shoehorned her way into unelected office. Theresa May could also have committed High Treason against the Sovereign. There is no doubt that May is a liar and cannot be trusted. She is not capable of negotiation and is incompetent as well as dishonest. Every day she stays as prime minister is another day the Conservative party will be out of office, unelectable and irrelevant. The Conservatives thus have two choices: dump May and survive or keep her and go under for the next thirty odd years. Already, thousands of Tories are abandoning the party but it will get a lot worse. Theresa May must go, and we must have a real Brexiteer in charge, not a Brixiteer in Name Only like the scallywags who backed May’s Chequers BRINO White Paper proposal.

The US president was condemned on social media for walking in front of the Queen as they inspected a guard of honour of the Coldstream Guards. She was left having to decide which side of him to go as she caught up to walk alongside him. Royal piggyback Then during a photo call, the president jumped unannounced up onto the Queen’s shoulders and started waving at the assembled press and Coldstream Guards making funny faces. The Queen kept her regal poise throughout the president’s antics, and shouldered the heavy burden quite remarkably for a woman in her nineties. Melania Trump, just ignored the whole event completely. “The Queen showed extreme strength and poise throughout the whole Trump event. Wow, she is so strong she did not even flinch once.” one Twitter user commented. A royal family spokesperson said the Queen piggyback was completely off royal protocol but because it was performed by the American president, it was laughed off afterwards as a show of American greeting. The monarchy’s official guidance online says there are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting the Queen or a member of the royal family, but many people wish to observe traditional forms. “For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women do a small curtsy. Other people prefer simply to shake hands in the usual way,” the royal website says.

Kommandant Selmayr, whose grandfather was lieutenant-colonel Josef Selmayr, a convicted war criminal – later pardoned – who served in the Balkans fighting for Hitler in WW2, has no love for the English. “Every time the Kommandant hears the name of an English person, or England, his face goes sour, I once saw him spit into his wastepaper bin when someone mentioned ‘Windsor Castle’. The Kommandant is very particular about the EU ruining Britain, he always says that even though Germany lost the war in 1945, we won in the end with the EU. He is of course correct 100%, because it is now the UK that takes orders from the EU, and who rules the EU? Yes, you guessed it — Germany!” Kommandant Selmayr was recently promoted to his post by Jean Claude Juncker, whose father was a prominent Nazi fighting on the Russian front in WW2 as well. Juncker’s father-in-law, Louis Mathias Frising — dad to Juncker’s wife of 35 years Christiane — was a teacher in Ettelbruck, Luxembourg, when the Germans invaded in 1940. Frising volunteered to be a Nazi propaganda chief while banning spoken French in favour of German. He was also responsible for enforcing a law which stripped Jews of their rights and professions — the first stage of the Holocaust. “So, as you can see you Englischer swine, the hierarchy of the EU is currently run by people who have a Nazi lineage.

We must also not forget the many who fought alongside the RAF, especially in World War II, the USAAF/USAF who bolstered the RAF from 1942 onwards in winning the war against Germany with many daring raids into enemy territory. The RAF during the Battle of Britain saved these shores from the Luftwaffe, with ultimate bravery and skill. RAF Bravery Pilots like Flight Lieutenant James Nicolson who was on patrol near Southampton on 16 August 1940, when his Hawker Hurricane was fired on by a German fighter aircraft. Making the ‘loudest noises [he] had ever heard’, four cannon shells thudded into his cockpit, damaging his machine, setting his petrol tank alight and wounding him in the eye, leg and heel. Surrounded by flames and with blood pouring down him from his injuries, Nicolson prepared to bail out. But just as he did so, he spotted a Messerschmitt Bf 110 ahead. Despite being in severe pain, he put down his parachute and reached instead for his gun controls. He poured fire into the German aircraft, keeping up his assault even as it tried to turn and twist away from him. As he attacked, Nicolson noticed that the intense heat of the cockpit was burning his flesh. Only then did he abandon his Hurricane. After giving the Messerschmitt one last burst, he struggled free of his blazing cockpit and tumbled out into the sky. Nicolson deployed his parachute and, as he fell, he took stock of his extensive injuries, noticing that he could see the bones of his left hand showing through the knuckles. He managed to land in a field and was rushed to hospital, where his life hung in the balance. After several weeks, he had recovered enough to make it out of danger, but the burns he had received took much longer to heal. Nicolson was awarded the Victoria Cross, which he received from King George VI at Buckingham Palace in November 1940. More Stories of RAF bravery here. USAAF After America joined the war in 1941, it was not until 1942 when the USAAF landed in Britain. The men of the 351st Bomb Group in their B-17 bombers were some of the bravest US airmen stationed in Britain, many perished over the Channel and Germany. Hollywood star, Clark Gable joined the group to bolster moral after a slew of heavy losses. From 1942-1945 350,000 Americans served in Britain as members of the Eighth Air Force, of which more than 21,000 sacrificed their lives.

His itinerary involves him travelling straight to Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, where Theresa May is supposed to host Mr Trump and his wife Melania for a black-tie dinner with 100 guests and ministers. The question is, after the Chequers fiasco, where Theresa May revealed her Brexit In Name Only plan, will the president want to meet Theresa May? The US Ambassador Woody Johnson, has already voiced his opinion on Theresa May’s BRINO plan, and has questioned whether any future bilateral US trade deals would be possible after the complete Chequers capitulation to the EU by May and her Remainer Cabinet. Donald Trump, who is conducting a trade war with the EU, will not be happy by Theresa May’s complete betrayal of 17.4 million voters who voted for a Brexit on June 23, 2016. “My guess is, Mr. Trump will attend the dinner, however, he will not be able to look in the quisling Theresa May’s eyes, out of shame for her, and how she betrayed her own country just to stay in office. He will speak a few words to her, but nothing important, and ignore the witch for the rest of the evening and the next day,” a senior Trump aide revealed. President Donald Trump will visit on the Friday, a defence installation where he will try to bolster NATO further by trying to persuade May to increase UK military spending, which will most probably be like trying to get blood out of a stone. Theresa May is not interested in Britain’s defence as she is Remainer and believes Britain should erradicate its armed forces so that the EU can save it during a time of war. Under her insipid reign, the armed forces have seen their military budget cut to a pittance, rendering it a useless fighting force if there ever were a conflict. On the same day, after the military discussion, Trump will be ferried off to Chequers, a scene of a grave crime against Britain. There, Theresa May will hope to discuss trade deals with the president, but it is not certain he will want to discuss them with May. Then after a non-working-lunch, it’s off to meet the Queen at Windsor Castle where Trump will amuse her Majesty with some of his American charm. The Donald, will then hang out in his golf courses in Scotland until he leaves on Sunday back to the US. Luckily for the president, he will go nowhere near Central London where a crowd of socialists and communists are planning a rally replete with a London Mayor approved blow-up doll of Trump fashioned as a big baby. The London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, instead of fighting rampant knife crime and murder in the Capital, is instead putting all of his effort into not only denigrating his own office with puerile anti-Trump shows but putting a big stain on the whole of the UK by agreeing to this pathetic socialist protest against a very important ally, and saviour of Britain in two World Wars.'], ['Boris and Other Brexit Heroes Vindicated After Resigning From Theresa May’s Treacherous EU-Centric Plan', 'We would like to extend our gratitude and utmost respect to those who fell in the line of BRINO fire, those who chose to sacrifice their own positions in the duplicitous lying Remainer-led Cabinet of Theresa May, those who stood up for their country and its principals as a Sovereign nation whilst others treacherously undermined it and tried to sell a disguised Brexit proposal to the masses and Ministers, when in fact it was a Brexit In Name Only. Theresa May, led the people and parliament on for two years proclaiming that she would take Britain out of the Single Market, out of the Customs Union, and secure the borders. Then on Friday, 6 July, she presented a completely new plan that would tie the UK to the EU indefinitely with no way of getting out, and would also make it nigh on impossible to conduct trade deals with our allies like the United States. The US Ambassador, Woody Johnson, was not the only one shocked by the Theresa May Brexit betrayal and has now stated that it is highly unlikely a bilateral trade deal between the US and UK can take place after the Chequers BRINO plan was revealed. Theresa May also alienated and ignored all Brexiteers in and out of the Cabinet, she surrounded herself and instated Remainers in high positions like the Treasury, where they thwarted any chance of a real Brexit. Philip Hammond, the Remainer Chancellor of the Exchequer, was a key player in thwarting Brexit. The Theresa May Chequers plan will involve the permanent continuation in the UK of all EU laws which relate to goods, their composition, their packaging, how they are tested etc etc in order to enable goods to cross the UK/EU border without controls. All goods on the UK manufactured in the UK for the UK domestic market, or imported from non-EU countries, would be permanently subject to these controls. Under Theresa May’s plan the UK would have to alter these laws in future whenever the EU alters its own laws. This would put the EU in a position to fashion its rules relating to goods so as to further the interests of continental producers against UK competitors, when we will have no right to vote on those rules. The obligation to follow the EU rulebook for goods would gravely impair the UK’s ability to conduct an independent trade policy. In particular, it will prevent the UK from including Mutual Recognition Agreements for goods in trade treaties and this is likely to destroy the prospect of successfully achieving meaningful agreements with some of the prime candidates such as the USA and Australia. The Theresa May Remainer Chequers plan therefore leads directly to a worst-of-all-worlds “Black Hole” Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state in the EU’s legal and regulatory tarpit, still has to obey EU laws and ECJ rulings across vast areas, cannot develop an effective international trade policy or adapt our economy to take advantage of the freedom of Brexit, and has lost its vote and treaty vetos rights as an EU Member State. Not only that, for this bogus turd of a proposal, the UK will have to pay the EU £40 Billion taxpayers money. How is that for a complete capitulation and kick in the bollocks?

The White Paper plan effectively ties the UK to EU laws and regulations indefinitely thus rendering a promised Brexit null and void. The plan was also most probably seen and given final approval by Donald Tusk, and Jean Claude Juncker. The duplicitous PM then presented the document to her Cabinet who agreed on its contents even though the White Paper gave away much of Britain’s sovereignty and freedoms. Theresa May threatened anyone who disagreed with the betrayal of British voters with the sack and bolstered many of the Cabinet members who were previously Brexiteers their aspirations for party leadership as a bribe. High Treason High treason is the crime of disloyalty to the Crown. By giving away Britain’s sovereignty to foreign powers; and plotting in consort with foreign powers against the sovereign status of the United Kingdom and adhering to the sovereign’s enemies, giving them aid or comfort; and attempting to undermine the lawfully established sovereignty of the land, Theresa May has wilfully acted against the Sovereign and committed High treason. Theresa May’s treachery does not stop there however, in the days to come, we will see further outcomes to how she sold off Britain’s sovereignty by simply renaming EU laws and incorporating them as UK laws so that Britain stays in the Single Market and the EU Customs Union effectively shackling the country with the EU indefinitely.

Constitutional National Crisis “It is a certainty that if the mandated EU Referendum vote for Brexit Britain taking back control of its borders, laws and trade, as was voted for on June 23, 2016, is not delivered, then there will be a voter backlash against the Conservative government. Essentially, the people who voted for a Brexit will vote against the Conservatives, and remove the Tories condemning them to a long hiatus in the wilderness. We estimate the strength of feeling in this matter to result in a twenty to thirty year exile,” Dr. Philip Arthur, revealed. There is certainly a threat of a vast voter backlash if there are serious capitulations to Brussels, and this would not fare well with the Conservatives for a long time. “We have studied the data, and analysed the behavioural habits of voters concluding these results of a voter backlash. However, we have also concluded that not only could there be a backlash at the polls, but the resultant discontent could spread to mass civil disobedience and rioting for a period of thirty to forty years.

It has to be said that behind the scenes must reside a chief Remoaner who is directing this farcical tragedy, and they are responsible for putting these Remoaners into the pot to stir things up. There is no logic in letting a Remoaner fifty feet within a Brexit negotiation. That’s like asking your enemy’s collaborator to come and discuss an important war strategy meeting against your enemy. It is therefore a valid supposition that the reason for instating Remoaners into the high positions dealing with Brexit, is to completely thwart the process, and at the moment, it seems to be working very well. If there was to have been a real Brexit, Remoaners would have been kept well away, because they are actively working against Britain’s interests, and seek to destroy any thought of a proper Brexit as voted by 17.8 million voters on June 23, 2016 during the EU Referendum. Solution: Unless there is an immediate removal of Remoaners from the Brexit proceedings and governmental control, then there will not be a Brexit, but Brexit can be achieved if these Remoaners are removed. That is the only way a real Brexit can occur. The likelihood of this happening at the moment are however very slim, simply because the Brexiteers we have in the mix do not seem to want to make any sort of move to oust the quislings. Until they remove the Remoaners, there will be big problems resulting in a ‘Brexit In Name Only’ (BRINO) or in other words a ‘Soft Brexit’, where the UK is still controlled by the EU.'], ['Tourist Special: 5 Paralysing Places to Visit in Salisbury', 'Visiting the medieval cathedral city of Salisbury situated in the southern English county of Wiltshire can leave you positively paralysed with awe at the magnificent history behind this great place. The city lies only 9 miles away from Stonehenge, the prehistoric stone circle on the grassland of Salisbury Plain. You won’t be able to move away after your visit and will stay in that spot for a very long, long time. We have compiled a list of five wondrous landmarks to visit on your trip to Salisbury. NoviChok Forest – If you love acres and acres of trees then you will not love this place. Most of the trees within the forest are now dead or diseased from some type of mysterious chemical compound. There are still a few trees standing so when you bring your picnic gear be prepared for involuntary nervous twitches just before succumbing to complete paralysis and entering into a coma. ChokNovi Cathedral – This magnificent 13th Century cathedral also holds the Magna Carta, which has now been re-written in Russian. Sit on a pue, and listen to the Bishop bash away some inane outdated mythical nonsense whilst you are paralysed in your seat, unable to even move your fucking eyes. When it is time to pray, simply slump forward in a coma. Not unlike any other church experience we hear you say, however this one is vastly different, you rarely wake up…ever again. The NoviFish ChokShop – Situated on the High Street down a dark alley, to get there you must step over many comatose bodies. These poor souls tried to get to the fish shop for a bit of cod and chips, but sadly never made it. You probably won’t either as you feel your muscles seize up after a few steps. Putin’s Laughing Pub – For a real taste of Salisbury, this pub is full of Russians, most certainly FSB agents who spend their days laughing at the British secret service for such a poor job catching them. Curiously enough, it is the safest place now in Salisbury as there is no nerve agent present. Why would the Russians want to infect themselves? No non-Russians or dogs allowed at any time. NoviPizza Chok Restaurant – What better place to put your feet up and relax after a hard day’s sightseeing than this excellent pizzeria. The only problem is, before your dish is served up, your throat will suddenly feel tight as the paralysis sets in and you will spend the rest of the evening staring at your food, frothing and dribbling from the mouth whilst smelling the delicious aroma, but without the ability to eat it.

The astounding England vs Colombia game last night at the Spartak stadium in Moscow was a tour de force of football and had spectators practically on their knees with excitement and anguish. End to end, with England leading by one goal, the Colombians pulled an equaliser out of a magician’s hat in the last minute of the game via numero 13, defender, Yerry Mina. Extra time to score that elusive goal, was elusive and we were onto penalties. This is the clincher, England are notorious at being shit at taking penalties, but this time around they bit the bullet and knuckled down with an excellent ‘thwack!’ from Eric Dier finalising the tally, thus consigning the Colombian team to another lonely and apprehensive journey home back to South America. Hopefully, Mateus Uribe and Carlos Bacca, who both missed their penalty shots, will be left in peace, and not gunned down just because some Cartagena cartel boss lost a bet. Returning to Colombia after leaving the World Cup, first thing to do is order in a posse of bodyguards until all the hysteria has calmed down a bit.

It was launched back on July 10, 2008 with a mere 500 apps. A press release published from Apple on their official website said: “it ignited a cultural, social and economic phenomenon that changed how people work, play, meet, travel and so much more.” There’s no question about that. Here’s three amazing bits of information from the press release. Today, the App Store is accessed by 1 billion users from 155 different countries, while as of June 2018 it has paid out over $100 billion to developers. The gaming industry is by far one of the biggest benefactors of the App Store. It has managed to bring a number of old and new titles to mainstream audiences. App Annie, one of the leading global providers of app market data, has compiled two lists that include the top games of all time worldwide based on downloads and consumer spend. Both reports take data from the iOS Store from July 2010 to May 2018. When it comes to the downloads top 10, the list is topped by Candy Crush Saga and then it’s followed by Subway Surfers, Fruit Ninja, Clash of Clans, Honour of Kings, Minion Rush, Angry Birds, Temple Run 1, 2 and Asphalt 8: Airborne. The usual suspects occupy the consumer spend list too, with the additions of Monster Strike and Puzzle & Dragons at numbers 3 and 4 respectively, Game of War at 7, while Clash Royale and Pokémon GO occupy numbers 9 and 10. App Annie estimates that while game apps account for 31% of downloads, 75% of the store revenue is generated from games. Even gambling brands, like casino and bingo sites that can be found on the review website Bingo Find have their own downloadable apps in the store. Nowadays, mobile gambling is a multi-billion pound business and the App Store has played its part in it, making these apps accessible to the masses. In more anniversary related news, according to SensorTower, Pokémon GO has managed to reach $1.8 billion in consumer spending after being on release for just two years. It is estimated that 58% of the revenue was generated from Google Play while the App Store accounted for the remaining 42%. Demonstrating the App Store’s influence, Riccardo Zacconi, CEO of King, creators of Candy Crush commented, “We launched Candy Crush Saga on the App Store over five years ago and it’s been hugely beneficial, allowing us to reach a brand new global audience. Our games have been played in all seven continents, including Antarctica! That shows just how influential and far-reaching the App Store has become.”'], ['Brexit Backbone Could Be Delivered to Parliament Say Experts', 'Parliamentarians are on standby today at the House of Commons for an emergency delivery of a backbone for any MP who is willing to take it regarding Brexit. “We have already established that the Prime Minister, Theresa May does not have a backbone, and that many so-called Brexiteers are also deficient of one. Remoaners do not have backbones as standard. However, in the interests of the nation’s standing, we are prepared to deliver one to be installed into any MP who is willing and capable of accommodating such a thing as a fucking backbone,” one of the controllers of the Backbone Section located deep in Whitehall revealed. Spineless cowards If requested, the backbone would be delivered to a special room in the House of Commons where it would be implanted into the person, and then they would deliver a proper Brexit as mandated by the people on June 23, 2016. “A lot of these fellows don’t have backbones. They are yellow jelly bellied cowards, so it is not certain how we would implement the project,” another controller revealed. Certainly, there are many contenders amongst the Brexiteer team, however one of them has to really step up to receive the backbone, and even then things could backfire. “Well it’s not just a backbone that will be required. We’ll also need a pair of big swinging bollocks. Without that combination then the backbone will not have full effect. Sorry ladies, but in this scenario you need some serious guts, and we know some of the ladies in parliament have that, but the balls are the final clincher, and of course a cigar, a Havana permanently stuck in the mouth.” Time is running out…better get that backbone ready.'], ['Bible Experts: Jesus Smoked Marijuana and Used Cannabis Oil For ‘Miracles’', '“If you smoke enough of this shit, you definitely will think you are Jesus the Son of God and can perform miracles,” one Bible scholar commented after toking on a large joint. According to a team of Bible scholars from Colorado University, marijuana and cannabis oil were common place during the era of Jesus in Judea, and much of the population were whacked out on the stuff. “Like say I smoked three joints off the cuff, then rubbed cannabis oil all over my body and I was on a mountain. It is highly likely I would see a burning bush and hear it talking to me. I mean this shit is so strong you hallucinate with it. If you have schizoid tendencies, you might even hear the voice of God telling you you have to sacrifice your own son to prove your unquestionable allegiance to the God. For fuck’s sake man, if someone did this shit today they would put them away permanently in an asylum…but because in the days of little or no science and goat herders, they put it in a book and called it the word of God.” Cannabliss Although the Christian Bible was written by unknown authors 400 years after the supposed events took place, it has been posited that many of the writers were on drugs too. “From the rhetoric of the Bible which was written during the fall of the Roman Empire and its transition to Christianity, many of the mystics that wrote the stories were on cannabis. It was a staple drug for many writers because it was good for the imagination. Writing while whacked out on ganja opens up avenues never before seen, so these people were going on about fables and mysteries of the era and expanding on them. There are no records of Jesus ever existing, even though the Romans were meticulous record keepers for taxation purposes. One must understand that Jesus is an amalgamation of many deities from the region, and at the time of the fall of the Roman Empire, they really needed something to supersede the authority of the emperors.” It was not only cannabis that many mystics took at the time, but psychotropic hallucinogenic substances derived from certain cacti, and plants. Harmal, Peganum harmala, was used all across the Middle East, not only as a mystical tool for hallucination but as a remedy for many ailments. Most world religions are derived from altered states of consciousness, and the root for many religions that still survive today comes from early shamanistic practices from early tribes who travelled the plains. These shamans ingested hallucinogenic plant derivatives and cannabis as an aid to acquiring an altered state of consciousness. “The process of grinding wild mushrooms, ingesting them then having an out of body hallucinogenic experience is as old as man itself. This dissociative state was seen as finding God. Basically, by taking mind altering drugs, man began to formulate their own religions from not only their surroundings but from their belief systems and expand upon these to create elaborate stories and religions. If you take enough drugs, you will see heaven, you will see hell and you will hear the words of God. Drugs are the channel to another state of awareness, and some say another dimension.” '], ['“Delaying Brexit is Crucial to Remaining in EU” Says Theresa May', 'When Remainer PM Theresa May says something, it generally means nothing, or it is doublespeak to enable further delaying tactics so that the outcome of said words is a muddled dish of confusion. Speaking to one group of people on one side, Theresa May says what they want to hear, then when speaking to the opposite side she will tell them exactly what they want to hear. The result is that nothing happens and the so-called event is delayed until it is too late, and the status quo can remain without any opposition. “I seek to confuse the Brexiteers, appease the Remoaners, and sincerely bow down to kiss the boots of the Brussels overlords. I am what would be deemed as a quisling, a sleeping agent within the highest office of government who detests the people, and their nefarious choice to leave the European Union. I say I believe in Brexit but that is not true. “My orders are thus to delay any exit from the EU for as long as possible, enabling Remoaners, the EU and the House of Lords to inflict as much pain on Brexit as possible. If I was a PM who wished for Brexit, this event would have occurred within three months of my instatement as PM, however I have eked proceedings out for over three years, and seek to delay for even more time.” As for the Brexiteers, they are fools for believing any words spoken from the PM, and yet they stand by, afraid to lose their positions in government more than their country’s future. This push and pull force, is a staple governmental technique utilised to fool the people, who watch daily as the appeasing headlines are released to the mainstream media. “Brexit is happening”, “Only Two Years to Brexit”, “EU Shaking in Their Boots”, “Support May in Her Brexit Victory”. Of course utter tosh and lies, but the people are placated easily, they actually believe the words they read in the papers, and the words that come out of Theresa May’s puppet mouth. The fucking stone cold truth is that there will be NO Brexit. No Brexiteers will stand up to Theresa May’s lies and Nigel Farage will stand by with the lot of them without doing anything. Remember these words clearly — The people’s vote does not matter. We are not living in a democracy. You have no rights as a voter to make a decision on the country’s future. The EU Referendum, 23 June 2016, is meaningless in the eyes of the EU, and controllers in charge of the government and business. Voters do not mean a thing in the UK. You are nothing to them.'], ['Calls to Ban Latin Word For ‘White’', 'The University of Linguistics in Mississippi is calling for the ban of the latin word for white – ‘Album’. The scholars for the university are outraged that the latin word for ‘black’ is banned, but not white. “These amount to double standards. Why ban the Latin word for black, but keep the word for white, it is a form of racism that we should not tolerate? We, today live by the standards and root of Latin, and this should be adhered to within our linguistic and societal discourse,” professor Reginald Dwight, told assembled college members at a recent meeting. Another scholar counteracted the argument by suggesting that the Latin word for black should be un-banned, therefore, the word for white, would be left alone and not banned as well. However, banning the word for the colour white in Latin, Album, could have implications in the music biz. Record executive, Donald D. Negreponte, for Warner Bros. was adamant that problems could arise. “What we gonna call albums then? We been callin’ that shiet albums since the beginning of the mufuggin’ recording industry. Niggaz need to all calm da fuck down, an shiet. I axe all y’all foos to stop runnin’ around like headless chickins and can the hysteria about Latin!” The discussion is ongoing, and many, especially in socialist states across America where there is a large African American lobby are not calling for the banning of the Latin word for the colour white, simply because it will mean that it is as important as the Latin word for black, which is banned from everyday usage. “You can’t ban the word white in Latin. Simply because by banning a word, you make it important, and you elevate it to a special status in linguistic usage. We don’t want whites to have the same special status as blacks in America, to use the word to lament over eternally, and to use it as a reason for our victim status. No! Definitely not,” Reverend Kessell Johnsons, said at a recent rally in Chicago.'], ['U.S. Border: Children Beg To Be Returned To Cages', 'Less than a week after President Trump sought to dispel public outrage by signing an executive order ending the practice of separating children from parents illegally crossing into the U.S., there has been a second—altogether unexpected backlash—from the kids themselves. Abe Moskowitz, a lawyer for six-year-old Emanuel Honduro Gonzalez, claims that once his client was reunited with his parents “he went into a full blown panic.” Emanuel was apparently having the time of his life in the cage. “Kids to befriend, an array of toys, plus state-of-the-art air-conditioning.” Moskowitz went on to point out that Emanuel’s situation certainly beat “trekking across the infernal 140 degree Arizona desert with only cactus needles as sustenance.” Emanuel’s reaction is in no way unique. Indeed, CNN has reported hundreds of cases of kids “kicking and screaming” and “throwing toys at I.C.E. members” once confronted with the crushing reality that they would be reunited with their parents. Analysis Psychologist Amanda Beasley, a professor at Yale University, explained it this way. “A child under the guidance of his parents is actually a thousand times more imprisoned than a child in a cage.” Beasley went on to suggest that “real individuation must start early—perhaps even a few weeks after the child is expelled from the womb.” Social Worker, Zeke Thomas, however, has a different point of view. “These kids are suffering from a cage-based version of Stockholm syndrome. The allure they have for their cages simply makes no rational sense!” Complicating matters further, many parents are reacting in unexpected ways to seeing their children again. Gloria Espinoza, a mother from Honduras, started feeling despondent and had to go on Lexapro shortly after being reunited with her three sons. Before she could watch Telemundo for days without interruption, but now she spends all her free time breastfeeding, changing diapers, and, on occasion, narrowly avoiding getting bludgeoned to death by a building block. Lupe Constanza feels similarly despondent and now takes a heavy-dose of Ativan since the return of her nine daughters and two sons has brought on a series of uncontrollable panic attacks. “I thought Trump was like Hitler for keeping us apart,” she said. “But now I think the real crime against humanity is reuniting our family. Some kids belong in cages.” DS Guest writer: Matt Nagin'], ['Democrats the More You Fight Trump the Stronger He Gets', 'From across the pond, somewhat removed, it is hard to see the American socialists making such a fool of themselves. These are supposedly inclusive people with an ideology of progressive tolerance and yet they are acting like fascists; non inclusive, intolerant, prone to censor, authoritarian, totalitarian and increasingly violent. Hitler himself would be proud of the Democrats because they are exhibiting the exact behaviour of the Nazi party leading up to World War II. Hitler’s National Socialist party was a form of socialism and left wing, they were intolerant of other views, they censored heavily and shut down any form of free speech. This is the left wing credo now, an intolerant, non inclusive hate mongering mob of thugs who cannot discuss anything in a civil educated manner. Your own hatred for Trump creates more hatred, because you are stuck in the mindset of anger, you create more anger, and your unwillingness to discuss or even acknowledge anything that is not in your worldview creates more discord and alienation. Donald Trump against the backdrop of wailing, whining violent bullying democrats looks civilised. Against the baying democrat hounds answering the race baiting call for violent action from Maxine Waters, Trump is again, the civilised one. The same goes for Peter Fonda, asking for paedophiles to rape Trump’s 11-year-old son, Barron. Donald Trump is the civilised one. To see Trump’s administrative staff hounded out of restaurants, confronted outside their homes, is similar in behaviour to the Jews in Nazi Germany being turfed out of shops and other public spaces. There is no positive mature educated behaviour being exhibited by American socialists at the moment, and frankly, you are the bad guys, because you are acting like bad guys act in everything you are doing. If it is violence the American socialists crave, then they would not fare well in a fight, because they don’t own guns, and don’t know how to shoot straight, whereas the conservatives do and can. Every day, Trump is increasing in strength, power and stature, whilst the democrats are looking increasingly dilapidated and silly. This applies to the media companies, the Hollywood celebrities, the pseudo-Marxist fascist university professors indoctrinating their flock, and the bleeding heart socialist thugs who have to virtue signal at every point of their miserable insufferable existence. Sometimes it pays to step back and look in to see what reality is really about, and for American socialists who manage to do that, they will not like what they see. For positive change to occur nationally, globally all sides must join collectively and inclusively because fighting only creates more fighting.

We had the adoption craze, and even one where celebrities kept dung beetles as the latest must-have pet. The latest craze is somewhat topical, as it relates to the Obama era policy of putting South American illegal migrants in cages at the U.S. border. Charlie Sheen now likes to spend weeks in a cage four feet across in a darkened room with only a box of cigarettes to accompany him and a pot of rancid water. Speaking from his cage in his Hollywood mansion, Sheen was eager to reveal the benefits of the new craze amongst celebrities. “I feel like I’m a kid who just walked across the border from Guatemala. It makes me proud to be American, because I not only feel at one with the United States, and Obama who started this practice, but I feel like a lost kid. Like I sit in the corner like this, I cry out for my mama and suck my thumb. I even have a blanket, although I burned some holes in this one with cigarette ash. I feel safe here. I don’t wanna get out.” Another celebrity who has adopted the cage life is Danny Devito, who sits in his cage and even wears a nappy. “I asked Arnie the other day if he wanted to join me in my cage. He said no, because he could not even fit his leg in it. They (Devito’s Mexican servants) cart me around the house in my cage, and they feed me burritos through the little hole. It makes me feel good as a liberal champagne socialist to be treated like those kids at the border, like I can atone for my liberal values by sitting in this cage and receiving the same punishment those poor Mexican bastards receive at the border.” There have been accidents though, and one celebrity did not fare too well whilst in her cage. Roseanne Barr tried out cage life after being barred from her own show because she uttered a few words on Twitter that were deemed racist. “They (the producers of her show) actually put me in the cage without my consent. Then they started making ‘Ook ook’ noises to show me what it feels like to be on the receiving end of racism. I cried and cried, but they still did not give me my own show back.” As for actor Peter Fonda, his latest hobby is not so much centred around a cage but an echo chamber. It could be described as a left-leaning digital prison where people parrot the same ol’ leftist outrage and it echoes from one side to the other for eternity — i.e Twitter.'], ['Epica Awards 32 Honours Responsibility and Imagination', 'T he Epica Awards announces its new jury president, two new grand prix and a dynamic ad campaign from Wieden + Kennedy The luncheon held in Cannes on June 21 announced the latest set-up for the Epica Awards in 2018.

Of course, because Obama was a socialist president, there was no outrage then, but because Trump is a conservative president today, the policies of Obama are being foisted on the shoulders of Trump. Actor Peter Fonda, was quoted on twitter after seeing the Obama era pictures: “WE SHOULD RIP BARRON TRUMP FROM HIS MOTHER’S ARMS AND PUT HIM IN A CAGE WITH PEDOPHILES AND SEE IF MOTHER WILL WILL STAND UP AGAINST THE GIANT ASSHOLE SHE IS MARRIED TO. 90 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STREETS ON THE SAME WEEKEND IN THE COUNTRY. FUCK,” What many ‘low information’ champagne socialists do not know is that the policy of putting immigrant children in cages was instated by the Obama administration. Since the outrage directed at the president is unjust and misguided, he has even gone out of his way to apply an executive order reversing many of the Obama era ICE policies. Naturally, the outrage shown by democrats has been used to its full effect against the Trump administration even though the policies they are crying over were instated by Obama.

The Obamas, who have kept a relatively low profile since leaving office, have established a company named Lower Ground Productions to manage the project. The New York Times has previously reported the former president was in talks to develop shows “that highlight inspirational gay and transexual stories” rather than delve into cheap political smears of conservative views and attitudes. The first episode of the series will focus on the bath houses of San Francisco and how they were instrumental in the emancipation of promiscuous gay men who spread AIDS across the country during the eighties. “I attended the bath houses a lot during filming, and it was truly inspirational to see the boys doing their thang. I was the towel boy, they would tell me which cubicle to go clean up, you know with a mop and a dirt rag. I talk in depth about the decor of these places, and the clients who frequent,” Obama revealed. During filming, Obama sustained an injury to his lower back after slipping on a load of semen left on the floor by a dozen men enjoying the bath house. “One minute I was holding the mop, then whoops, I fell flat on my back. Luckily I was brought back to my feet by some hunky guys who then taught me a lesson or three for being so gymnastic in their presence.” “I have a dream..” The episode will suggest that every American city and town must have bath houses installed, not only to comply with modern inclusion rules, but to provide a firm ground for the spread of HIV throughout the country. “I have a dream. Every city corner, every town centre, to have at least two or three gay bath houses,” Obama says defiantly at the end of the episode.

The Lisbon Treaty was secretly signed away by Gordon Brown, and gave away much of Britain’s sovereignty. It was quickly taken through without even a consultation or murmur. No one of course mentions that, or any other pro-EU treaty that was secretly pushed through without any consultation or ‘Meaningful Vote’. These are double standards and hypocrisy. Business 101, you cannot go to the deal table without the ability to walk away. If you do not have the ability to walk away, you have effectively lost any bargaining power, and are defenceless. This is what the Remoaners and traitors are seeking to do with Brexit. Their treachery and hatred for Britain bolstered purely by their own greed as they receive large pension funds and payoffs from the enemy, Brussels. Choke on it Hope you enjoy the money you have acquired by selling off your own country to people who mean only harm to the UK, Dominic Grieve. Your Remoaner treason may hopefully one day come back to haunt you, as you choke on the thousands of pounds/euros put into your accounts by Brussels. May your duck houses flourish with diseased ducks and your country mansions paid for by your treachery rot with inequity and bad luck.'], ['Merkel Sneaks Past Migrants Washing at Berlin Hauptbahnhof Train Station', 'On her latest trip to Strasbourg for an EU meeting on mass unfettered migration into the Schengen zone, Chancellor Angela Merkel was caught up in a rather embarrassing situation. “The Chancellor was dropped off and was making her way to her train platform when she was greeted by a number of migrant men washing their feet and other body parts from a tap on the main concourse,” Merkel’s attache, Hans Gruper, told Bild. The Chancellor was immediately embarrassed by the situation and tried to sneak past the collection of men washing. At one point, a man pulled down his trousers and proceeded to wash his anus with nothing more than his hand and cold water. One onlooker found the event quite amusing. “I saw Merkel holding her breath as she attempted to sneak past the group, but the sight of the man’s anus being washed in front of everyone was too much, even for the Chancellor. Of course, it is not the fault of the migrants, this is how they live in their culture and are not phased by such actions, but in Germany it is not normal or civil behaviour.” Chancellor Merkel did eventually catch her train to France, albeit with a little trauma on the way. Since the massive influx, in Europe it is quite common to see such displays in public places.'], ['Home Secretary Sajid Javid Bans Zombie Knives', 'The newly appointed Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, attends a Number 10 briefing shortly after his attack. Lawless London Update In a recent tabloid interview, Mr Javid said he was standing outside Euston station when the moped thugs rode on to the pavement. They deposited a large Zombie knife deep into his head and zoomed off, he said, which left him “angry and upset”. He said he is now working on a review to give police more power to pursue moped murderers and thugs. “Before I knew what was happening, this large Zombie knife was embedded firmly in my brain,” said Mr Javid, who was appointed home secretary in April, becoming responsible for the UK’s policing and security. Speaking of the incident, which happened last Tuesday, he said: “I was angry and upset but thought myself lucky they did not steal my precious iPhone or Rolex watch as have many who fall prey to these vicious criminals.” His revelation comes days after unfunny ‘comedian’ Michael McIntyre was robbed by men on a moped in north-west London. Home Office proposals announced this month aim to ban the sale of the weapon of choice of these moped thugs — Zombie knives. The new Home Office rules will also give police powers to pursue criminals if they have committed a crime. “If someone commits a crime and police want to pursue them, they should be allowed to.” Meanwhile in London, it is all too easy to acquire hand guns, sold for as little as £50 a piece in most pubs, and even though Zombie knives are now banned as well these can easily be found in any open market for £10.

Concession after concession has left the government with no negotiating power with Brussels, and is now swamped not only by the House of Lords, but by traitorous Remainer MPs on the Soros payroll. These greedy treacherous swine Haw Haw Remainers, who are willing to betray Britain for a few quid are vile miserable creatures only fit for the stocks, to be displayed to all and sundry as rotten tomatoes and excrement are thrown at their ugly putrid faces. The devil’s daughter has thus spawned another batch of slimy eggs from her overworked puckered anus, as she delivers another Remainer plot to derail Brexit with a disgusting squishy popping sound. Soubry, a militant treasonous satanic witch deserves only one thing, to be punted full force in her grime box. Maybe it is time to punish the useless Conservatives once and for all. No one dared to oust the pigeon liver’d lying coward with no backbone May, even though she has shown countless times to be a retrograde abhorrent Remainer not worthy of a squirt of piss from a pig’s straining bladder.

As former president and token black president Obama sat on his haunches for eight years whilst twiddling his Marxist agenda around, Trump has achieved economic success, and something no other U.S. president could achieve — a peace treaty with North Korea. Now that Kim Jong Un has come in from the cold, the Democrats are very silent…apart from Robert De-Niro who yesterday said the eloquent words ‘Fuck Trump’. What happened to Bobby eh, he was great in the early days, Deer Hunter, King of Comedy, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Casino, Heat, but now he has turned into some sort of sap who can only make threats to a president who is actually moving mountains and get parts in shit movies like The Intern. Who would have thought, De Niro’s politics were that of a red commie bastard? What a fucking douche. Over in old Blighty, we wish we had half the leadership of Trump, instead we are being led by a grey old boot Remainer with no fucking balls, no guts or charisma. Theresa May is a wet diarrhoea spillage not worthy of anything but the glue factory where they send old forgotten nags to get processed. She is a dead rotting carcass with no life, no chutzpa, no plan, and has wrecked Brexit simply because of her insipid lifeless non-personality, her purposeful stalling, and her treasonous Remainer appointees. What did Obama achieve apart from introduce a failing health care system into America that is costing people way more for way less treatment? Obama lost the Ukraine to Russia. Obama spent trillions of U.S. taxpayers money on useless socialist pet projects that have doomed future generations of America to vast un-payable debt. When Obama was elected U.S. debt was 9 trillion, at the end of his eight year reign it was 23 trillion dollars. Where is Barack Hussein Obama now? Who fucking cares? Him and his horrid cantankerous moose beast of a wife can rot in obscurity and Oprah appearances. Trump has done more for African Americans than Obama ever did. He has brought massive employment to blacks, and also is not agitating the racial situation, something that Obama and his pal Soros tried to do during his evil term of office. The constant riots and agitating, the race baiting, was all Obama, who encouraged African Americans to riot pushing racial disharmony and hatred of white Americans. History has spoken and Donald Trump has Trumped Obama a thousand times over. As for Nobel Peace prizes, if Trump does not get one for his achievement in North Korea, then it is a flawed, biased prize, because Obama only got the prize for the colour of his skin, and he achieved nothing during his tenure. What’s left for Trump now? Well, we got the wall, the trade war to make things fairer, a possible Iran incursion and cleaning out the Marxist agitators from internal governmental operations, amongst many other projects in the pipeline. Bravo Trump, balls of fucking steel. On the other hand, what does this mean for the world order? How will N. Korea fit into the Trump World Order? Could there be a disturbance in the Force?'], ['Age of Feminism: Woman Complains When Men Do Not Help Her', 'Men have been continually attacked, vilified and made into third rate citizens for decades by the media, feminists and general anti-male #metoo one woman agenda. It comes as no surprise then that men are just leaving women alone, because in the end men cannot win if they help a woman or leave them alone. No doubt, this is what happened in a recent incident in the London Underground when a woman was attacked verbally and physically by a mentally unstable nutter. The two men in the carriage casually walked off into the adjoining carriage leaving the woman alone with her attacker. There is little cause for modern feminist women to be alarmed by this, because it is a hole dug solely by themselves as they have alienated men to such a level that men are going their own way, and leaving women alone to get on with it. The chivalrous male still lives on only in the imagination, because to open a door for a woman is seen as a serious sexist chauvinist act, and to protect a woman in this day and age can lead to men being prosecuted for sexist outrage, let alone daring to compliment a woman on her looks. One cannot even ask a woman out on a date, or her phone number without being dragged through the courts, or feminist friendly newspapers. The media is now chock block full of articles where innocent men are charged with rape when in the past it would be labelled as bad fumbling uncommunicative sex. The #metoo generation is one of thug rule, of judgement and sentence before fair trial, of alienating men to such a level that repair of the damage meted on relations with the opposite sex are nigh on impossible. It is to this sorry end, that many men now leave women alone even when they see a female being viciously attacked. This is what Third Wave Feminism has created and this is the lonely bed women must now lie in.'], ['Donald Trump Told Off For Shitting On G7 Summit Table', 'The President of the United States, Donald Trump was told off for doing a series of large shits on one of the G7 summit tables during a luncheon. Much like a puppy has to be broken in, the summit leaders, Angela Merkel and French President Macron, along with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau told the American president off for his big smelly turds, which attracted large bluebottle flies into the luncheon room. German Chancellor, Angela Merkel scolded the Donald for ‘doing a very very bad thing, mein gott!’ and even threatened to rub his nose in it as a lesson. Watched by other G7 summit attendees, even the Japanese PM balked at the disgusting display, upturning his nose when the smell hit his nostrils. The incident occurred during luncheon, when all the delegates were sitting at their tables, and the food was served. “We had just been served the first course of celeriac risotto, toasted buckwheat, truffle, Chanterelle mushrooms, rosemary and celery leaf when Mr. Trump stood up, undid his trousers and pulled down his Y-fronts. He then positioned his large buttocks over the plate and these large turds came out of his asshole as he grunted with gusto. He seemed to find it pleasurable as his eyes rolled up showing only the whites as large pieces of excrement flopped unceremoniously onto the table and plate. The smell hit us immediately and some delegates vomited. Mr. Trump giggled like a little boy as he wiped his messy ass with the expensive cloth napkins, even grabbing Theresa May’s napkin when finished with his one,” a shocked Canadian PM Trudeau recalled. After the display, the delegates crowded around Mr. Trump to tell him off and tried to educate him in the ways of G7 summit etiquette. Political commentator and psychologist, Bernard Ernst, examined Trump’s behaviour and tried to rationalise it afterwards. “Mr Trump is a primal animal. This is the way he showed his displeasure, by taking a big shit on the table. It is obvious that he does not approve of events at the G7 summit, and what he also did was to designate the area as his territory, much like a dog does with urine and excrement.” It remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump will be invited back to the next G7 Summit.'], ['Tourists Flock to London to Get Murdered', 'Under the careful apathetical watch of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, London’s murder rate is now triple of Bogota or Cartagena. Tourists who are keen to experience this phenomenon are travelling to London to encounter the murder first hand. Juan Motola, 43, from Fort Lauderdale, USA, is fascinated by grim tales of the city’s past: “I would read about Jack the Ripper and what he did in the East End when I was a kid. I always imagined the cobbled streets of London amongst the fog and flashes of knives as a poor lady of the night was gutted and left for all to see. I’m coming to the death capital this time to see it all first hand.” Tourists don’t need to buy expensive tickets to the London Dungeons, or Madame Tussauds, because the real action is on the streets. Stewart Penrose, a crime consultant reveals the best times to get murdered in the city, as well as the prime spots for a quick dispatch. “You don’t want to come onto the streets at rush hour in the morning from 7am to 10am. The reason for this is that the Afro Caribbean gangs who commit most of the crime don’t have jobs, and are usually still in bed. If you want a good stabbing, walk the streets after about midday, and of course the night time is the best for getting shanked or chopped by a machete. Don’t forget to flash your Rolex watch or expensive camera wherever you go, this will quicken your demise considerably. South of the river is now the best place to go to get murdered. It’s like the Wild West.” Because there are no police on the streets of London anymore, thanks to the London Mayor’s orders, violent crime has risen as much as by 80% in some areas. Tourist Abel Dannon, from France arrived in London on a Tuesday, and had been murdered by Wednesday his brother revealed. “He was sad about breaking up with his girl. He bought a one way ticket to London, and we wondered why. According to reports, he was seen walking down Croydon High Street holding up job application leaflets. The last I heard was it was a quick death for him. About twenty thugs descended upon him with machetes. People just stepped over his mangled body for hours.” Indeed, murder now is so common place that many bodies scattered on the streets are routinely ignored. “It’s just another day in a Labour run city. I had to step over four bodies and a severed hand this morning on the way to work. Luckily I did not spoil my suit,” Stockbroker, Giles Mathers, revealed in the Evening Standard newspaper.

The vistas of the city and its renowned architecture will satisfy the attendees from the delicately decorated roof gardens where we will convene after the meetings in the evening. To say it is a great honour to be invited would be an understatement, but after our recent Kissinger interview it was somewhat expected. At the moment, I’m trying to figure out what to take in my little bag (not the old lady) to the luxurious hotel we have been booked in. Sorry mes amis, but I cannot divulge the location, but will give you a few tips. It is relatively close to the Royal Palace, and a 5-minute walk from Piazza Vittorio Veneto, it is however near a grotty shopping centre, not that delegates will do much walking. Valentino Castle – former residence of Royal House of Savoy. As with regulations, on pain of death, I cannot say much more. All this tosh about groups of young ladies being escorted into the rooms is something I can say does not happen. You only get to choose one or two for the night, not more than three much to my chagrin, and there is a pecking order, hopefully no sloppy seconds or thirds. George ‘7 Jobs’ Osborne and other Remoaners will be attending, they seek to fight the populism encroaching on their territory, and I will be the dissenting voice of reason to their avarice and greed.

It’s of course their #MeToo right to claim I raped them, but I was too balls deep at the time to even think about anything. You know when you’re moving inside, it just feels like home to me, you lose all track of time or anything from the sheer pleasure, there ain’t nothing wrong with doing it, so I got no need to apologise for something that feels so goddamn right. As a #MeToo campaigner, I say to these women, I say, “Me too” I know how it feels when people don’t believe a word you say is true. I never lied a day in my life.” During the book signing, a woman who looked suspiciously like Monica Lewinsky, smoking a long soaking wet cigar, was in the line awaiting a signed copy of the book, she was replete in a blue dress with many crusty white stains all over the front and back. One woman in the queue said she smelled of stale semen and Havana, and complained to the publisher’s assistant who was attending the signing. “I’m not sure what her game was, but I called her out, and when she saw she was rumbled she quickly fled the store in tears,” the woman from New Jersey said. Hissssssssssssss Just at that moment, there was a hissing sound which filled the whole room causing everyone, including Bill Clinton to turn around. The horrific sound emanated from Hillary Clinton who turned up wearing a scarf over her thick overcoat in the 90 degree heat, stumbling all over the floor, her eyes seemed to not have any control in where they looked. At one point, one eyeball looked to left whilst the other went right. One spectator was traumatised by the sight. “I saw Hillary hissing in anger. Like with real venom. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. She had seen Monica in the queue and got off her wheelchair much to the concern of her physician. Her tongue was long, it fluttered and flickered like a lizard or snake’s. She went towards Bill full of rage, but luckily was stopped when she fell flat on her face and knocked herself out completely.” It’s safe to say that Bill Clinton and co. have landed precipitously in the #MeToo generation with an almighty squishy bang!'], ['Sick as a Parrot? World Cup fever will hit the UK hard', 'E very four years during the summer, the number of ‘unauthorised absences’ at UK businesses suffers a sharp upturn. This head-scratching anomaly is made even more curious by the fact that the four-year cycle matches the four-year circle of the FIFA World Cup, precisely. Of course, in reality this convergence of sickies and football is not too hard to understand, and a recent survey held by the football tipping site FootballTips.com had revealed that workers in the UK are not exactly abashed to admit that they ‘play hookey’ during the four weeks of the world’s greatest sporting tournament. Naturally, one of the main joys of sneaking off work during the World Cup Finals is getting away with it scot-free – but if you’re tempted to miss work to watch Panama take on Tunisia during this year’s finals, then don’t rest on your laurels that you’re going to get away with it. Out of the 2,203 people aged eighteen and over questioned by FootballTips, 41% of them said they’d been hauled in front of their bosses for a dressing down over their absenteeism. The first question asked in the survey was “How many days will you take off work to watch the World Cup this year?”. The average answer was a whopping seven days, but when asked how many of these absences would be unauthorised, that figure dropped to four. Hopefully you’re asking yourself where are these companies that allow employees to take three ‘authorised’ absences just to watch football. Survey respondents were also asked if they had taken time of work to watch the 2014 World Cup, and 68% of them said that they had, and, as mentioned above, 41% of those who took time off for the football found themselves in trouble for doing so. If you need to find some quick bogus excuses for time off during this year’s finals, note that ‘a doctor’s appointment’ was the most popular reason given by employees for a World Cup sickie at 32%, with a straightforward ‘I’m too ill to work’ next at 20%. Winning the third-place play-off is ‘a family emergency’ at 17%. Calculating the cost the World Cup makes to the UK economy is no easy task, but if we take that 44.5 million people watched the 2014 World Cup in the UK, and that 43% of them were in full-time employment, that gives a workforce of 19 million people. If each took seven days of seven hours off at a rate of around £14 per hour, that gives us (19 million x 7 x 7 x 14) £13 billion in lost revenue. A spokesman for FootballTips, Tom Rooney, said “The World Cup is of course a hugely important time for many of us living in the UK, even though England usually do terribly. It is surprising how many people plan to take time off to watch the games, especially as over half of this time is likely to be unauthorised. If you do plan to pull a sickie instead of going to work, at least avoid posting anything on social media!” Let’s hope for the UK’s economy that England don’t go and win the 2018 version of the tournament, else the total money lost could become astronomical!'], ['London Mayor Says Stabbing Spree Bloodbath Good For Population Control', 'Croydon, London Labour’s London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has justified the current crime spree amongst predominantly black people as a ‘natural form of population control’ and has even gone on to proclaim it as a form of ‘eugenics’. It was in fact the socialist creed of William Beveridge, the architect of the post-1945 welfare state, and highly active member in the eugenics movement who said that “those men who through general defects are unable to fill such a whole place in industry are to be recognised as unemployable. They must become the acknowledged dependents of the State… but with complete and permanent loss of all citizen rights – including not only the franchise but civil freedom and fatherhood”. The plan in those days was simple, as proposed by other socialist thinkers like Bertrand Russell. The gene pool for the elite must not be tainted by inferior bloodlines, and all ‘useless eaters’ should be sterilised or aborted before birth. Today, they’re just killing themselves off with mass stabbings and shootings. Nothing to Lose As the disenfranchised ethnic youth today in London continue on their stabbing sprees, the problem today is one predominantly of the Afro-Caribbean youth.

They are ill educated, with no desire for education or legitimate jobs. They are essentially wild feral beasts on the rampage, and can only express themselves with extreme violence, thuggery and thievery. These are Labour’s children. We cherished and nurtured their non-education through our welfare system by rewarding failure. We invited their parents in to this country knowing full well their children would create complete chaos, fear and discord, as this was good for our socialist longterm agenda to always have ‘useless eaters’ vying for our supposed help and vote for us.

Many parts of South London, and urban council estates are now war zones thanks to the Labour policies of the past where it was mandatory to build estates bang in the middle of affluent areas. This form of social engineering has created clear delineation, where on one side the affluent live in perpetual fear, and on the other the chaotic hopeless create crime. “In London, you can live in a £3 million property, but walk a few yards across the road and you will find a council estate where drug gangs rule, where people are stabbed daily, and where the disenfranchised only have to look out of their windows to see how the other half live. It is possibly a cruel form of torture for these people who know that the only way they will receive any large reward is by drug running or by murder. This is what Labour created.

It’s a four week fiesta of football where most of – not all, there are several big name players who won’t be involved in the tournament, because of injury or due to their nation’s failure to qualify – the world’s best will be strutting their stuff. The best part? Discovering ‘new’ stars or players who take the tournament by storm. There are always a few in every World Cup – those players who we already know about but who step up with a string of exciting performances. So, with all due respect to established greats such as Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, here are six players worth keeping an eye on this summer. Timo Werner – Germany Look out for Werner in this World Cup. He’s got a crucial role to play for defending champions Germany, who are, not surprisingly, among the bookies’ favourites to win again. If they do triumph on July 15, they’ll surely need Werner’s goals. With Miroslav Klose long retired and Mario Gomez now 32, Werner is Germany’s new big goalscoring hope. He’s still quite the novice in terms of international football but the 22-year-old Leipzig striker scored seven goals in his first 13 caps – a fast and impressive start. Antoine Griezmann – France Not exactly a bright young prospect – Griezmann turned 27 this year so he’s in his prime – but this is a big tournament for the Frenchman. Actually, it’s going to be a big couple of months. For starters, his club future has been the subject of wild speculation, with a move from Atletico Madrid to Barcelona strongly tipped. It could be a career-defining transfer for Griezmann. In the tournament, there will be a massive focus on him. In the 2014 World Cup, he featured in five matches but failed to score. This time, according to the odds, he should be contention to be 2018’s top scorer. Can he deliver on his promise? Hirving Lozano – Mexico This lad could be something very special indeed. He might not be widely known outside of Mexico or the Netherlands – where he plays his club football, for PSV Eindhoven – but that’s going to change over the next few weeks. Lozano is a goalscoring winger who can play on the right or left, and his single season with PSV was a huge success. He scored 17 goals in 29 games for the Eredivisie club, and his return of seven in his first 27 caps for Mexico is pretty decent. PSV won’t want to sell him but if they do, they can expect a healthy mark-up on the £7m they paid for him in 2017. Paulo Dybala – Argentina There are other players in Argentina’s squad besides Messi and despite the never-ending coverage surrounding the Barcelona superstar, the South Americans have a lot of other talented footballers in their ranks. Indeed, if Argentina are going to win a first World Cup since 1986, Messi won’t be able to do it all on his own. Dybala is one of the strong supporting cast. He’s in that group of good players who aren’t quite in the top bracket – yet. A versatile striker – he can play as a centre-forward or just behind – his international career hasn’t really got going; he hadn’t scored for Argentina in 12 appearances when the squad was finalised. Time to break his duck? Aleksandar Mitrovic – Serbia Something of a leftfield choice, perhaps, but Mitrovic will be a pivotal figure in Serbia’s campaign. Not only that, he’s box office viewing. When he plays, don’t take your eyes off him. He’s just as likely to pull a goal from nowhere as he is to do something reckless; at his worst he can be hot-headed. But at this best, he’s a powerful, influential centre-forward. And his goalscoring record at this level has to be respected, with 13 goals in his first 36 caps. It’s easy to forget that he’s still only 23, with his best years ahead of him. Gabriel Jesus – Brazil Want to feel old? Jesus was only 17 at the time of the last World Cup – fast forward four years and he’s part of a dazzling Brazil forward line. He might be the junior member of the squad but don’t expect the Manchester City striker to be there simply to make up the numbers; he captained the team in a recent friendly. His scoring record for Brazil is impressive too – his first 16 caps yielded nine goals. He may yet upstage senior colleagues Neymar and Roberto Firmino.'], ['Cultural Marxism – Death By Twitter – Roseanne', 'All it takes is a few words, a few well chosen words can make or break people on Twitter. People have been arrested for words on Twitter, people have lost their jobs, people have been made social outcasts and ostracised…just from a few words. How can we rationalise this extreme power that a few well or not well chosen words can impact so highly on either yourself or others? There is no doubt that words have power, however when put in a certain spotlight, there is an almost exponential rise in the power of those words. Analysing the goldfish bowl prison of Twitter, it is a bacterial incubator of human brain farts, and people do say some silly things, including so-called celebrities. In this light, should people be accountable for such brain farts? Not necessarily… What is all this seriousness about? Are we not all creative, chaotic creatures flailing around in the cold hard digital blackness? If someone makes a brain fart, they somehow got their fingers to compute the brain fart and put it onto the public notice board of Twitter. That single brain fart is not and should not sum up a complete human being. We as humans have numerous facets, we have numerous levels to our being, and it is sad that many are judged just for one singular mistake, some little thought that came out wrong, or that proverbial brain fart that somehow leaked out onto the keyboard. Is this our future? A future where we cannot make mistakes? Not even once, are we allowed to transgress, or move in a diagonal off beat way? Maybe it is cultural Marxism that is now so pervasive it is intoxicating, and stepping out of line with the PC mono-culture, the Sovietized conformity where everyone speaks in the same way, everyone thinks in the same simplistic ways is the norm. Imagine a vast grey landscape and billions of grey people come marching along, singing the same bland song and wearing the same grey clothes. THIS is what the internet is turning into, where all the free-thinkers, the true creatives and the eccentrics of the world are whittled down into a morose grey dust. Without the dreamers, the creatives and the exuberant eccentric characters, everything is stale, joyless and bland. This is why we should celebrate the brain fart, we should celebrate the mistakes that people make, and any creative person knows, there are happy accidents we make that sometimes formulate themselves into big ideas, big solutions, and off centre thinking creating radical changes that impact the whole of humanity. Do not fire people for words, do not arrest them? This is a form of tyranny, a form of totalitarian nastiness that George Orwell warned about. We should all be able to express ourselves however wrong, abhorrent or offensive it may seem to one certain group, or another clique or a whole swathe of people. As an artist, if people are offended by your work, then you are doing something right. You have touched people, and this is what artists do. To evolve as humans, we must therefore diverge from what there is now. Mistakes should not be punished, because making mistakes in life is a profound tool for growth, of course, this runs into the ultimate cliche that we learn more from our mistakes than we do from our successes. This is why Roseanne, should never be fired for her words on Twitter. She has now had her show cancelled by the ABC network, and she made some mistakes, she mouthed off, but even though we may not agree with her, we should still defend her right to say what she said with our lives. Freedom of speech means protecting all speech, including anything that is deemed offensive, or off centre. Everything and everyone should be allowed to express themselves…because this is the only way humanity will truly grow…without that, there is only a one-sided view. What about double standards? It is apparently okay for a comedian on the American left to show off a decapitated head of a president, yet to make silly remarks about Planet of the Apes is not permissible. If this means a furious Michelle Obama demanding Roseanne’s cancellation directly to the boss of Disney, we ask ourselves, who has the power today in America? That being said, at the end of the day, in this age, should humans still be punishing other humans for something they have no control over — the colour of their skin they were born with? You are born this way, you cannot change it, you cannot change your race, your DNA or genome…so why punish people for something they cannot change? Man..it’s one big clusterfuck…'], ['The Italian Job: EU Technocrat Sent By Germany Dissolves Any Thoughts of Democracy in Italy', 'Imagine such a shock to the system, a democratically elected government tries to appoint their own finance minister, only to have an EU lackey and traitor to Italy thwart the appointment. From there, it is a repeat of a story told many times by the EU. Once the democratically elected elements disintegrate, an EU technocrat is shoehorned into the post as prime minister to keep the EU house in order. There is definitely no democracy involved in this EU move, as the EU abhors any form of democracy, as can be seen by the Brexit imbroglio, a muddied field of shit that even the most hardened Glastonbury-goers would balk at. Unfortunately, this scenario is not a scene from some Hollywood film describing the destruction of the democratic process but just happened with the Italian quisling president Sergio Mattarella appointing former IMF goon, Carlo Cottarelli as the desired technocratic outcome to the post of PM despite a fairly elected democratic government wishing otherwise. All of this is valid proof that democracy does not and cannot exist in the European Union. After all, it is a body ruled completely by unelected officials, who many do not know the names, or what they do. As Jean claude Juncker, the EU president once said about British calls for a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty: “Of course there will be transfers of sovereignty. But would I be intelligent to draw the attention of public opinion to this fact?,” How about what Juncker said about the French referendum on the EU constitution: “If it’s a Yes, we will say ‘on we go’, and if it’s a No we will say ‘we continue’,” This is why anyone who supports the EU is essentially anti-democratic, and does not view their own sovereignty with any value. As for the poor Italian voters, your vote does not obviously count for shit in your own country, and what the disgraceful EU really means is finally dawning on some of you.

Protein rich and yummy. I pour the cockroach milk over my cereal in the morning and have a few drops with my coffee,” Mrs Obama told Marie Claire magazine. In October, Michelle Obama will be featured in her own Netflix show to promote healthy eating to Americans. Said to be the superfood for the Millennial era, many are even harvesting their own Hawaiian Pacific Beetle cockroaches at home, then milking them daily to extract the gooey milk that holds protein crystals. Hannah Gutter, a democratic party worker from Los Angeles has even named her cockroach brood, consisting of 240 cockroaches which she houses in her tiny apartment she shares with her girlfriend. “I love my cockroaches, I even name them, like see the one with spot on its back, that’s Spot, and the other one over there mating, that’s Harvey. I hope he got consent.” Milking time Extracting the milk from a cockroach can be a tedious business, and it takes Hannah four hours a day, but it’s worth every minute, in her point of view. “You pick them up one by one, then I rub their crotch area gently slowly picking up the pace. When you hear this clicking agitated excited sound, you know they’re close to popping. That’s when they usually shoot their gooey milky load all over the place, so you have to catch it in a cup. Afterwards some of them get really sleepy, and I put them in a quiet place to sleep it off.”'], ['GDPR: How the EU Managed to Fuck Up the Whole Internet in One Fell Swoop', 'The EU, is a soviet entity obsessed by regulations.

You cannot sneeze or take a shit in the EU without being bogged down by EU regulations.

This is obviously just about power for the EU and nothing else, it is just stating to the world that it has carte blanche to issue communistic diktats to everyone, without reproach. Priests have even stopped praying in church because of the EU ruling. Shutting down EU operations however does not protect web companies because the EU law applies to to EU citizens wherever they are in the world, therefore these websites that have shut out EU users within the EU can still be punished by the EU.

This massive shift into a new epoch of technological advancement will be akin to the Industrial era of the 19th Century in Europe. In essence, the changes that will be incorporated will have vast significant repercussions but will essentially be a huge leap forward. The technology that will change humanity forever is something that many will be scared by at first. Much of the biological body is not necessary, and humans have hardly evolved in thousands of years. We are still adapted to an existence thousands of years in the past. Future technological advances will thus incorporate nano machines within the body. There will not be any need to eat or breathe as microscopic machines sustain us from the inside. Backing-up your computer hard drive is a necessity, and it is incomprehensible that the human mind cannot be backed-up today. How many great scientific, artistic, literate minds have been lost so far? The future will ensure this never happens again, and we will be able to back-up our minds in full. Medical science is still in the stone age, even though some are trying to move forward, possibly ahead of their time. To augment, to enhance, to evolve. This is why brain implantation technology will revolutionise humanity in a huge leap in evolution. To begin first though, scientists will have to map out every dendrite, every neuron, every synapse and axon — a task that is enormous considering the fact that every human brain is different and unique. Coupled with advancements in robotics, and artificial intelligence, humans will be able to formulate new ways of transport, and a new understanding of our universal standing. Creating sentient beings that will be able to design, adjust and build other sentient beings will be the ultimate step towards a future that will enable earthlings to colonise new worlds across the universe. This is why science and technology must be funded to the highest levels now, why we must put all of our efforts into making that evolutionary leap forward. The future need not be a Brave New World, but one of ultimate technological creativity, of limitless possibilities encouraged to the full and not encased in moral boundaries and legal limitations. Enhancing humans, amalgamating with machinery is the future, and from there all the current problems of humanity can be solved. Some may say that conquering death through technology is a loss of humanity and soul, this is where they are wrong because everything in this universe has its own vibration, and a reason for existence.'], ['No More Lads Stuff – Prince Harry Doomed As Meghan Declares Feminist SJW Agenda', 'hoc est bellum Prince Harry, the ultimate royal lad who loves the rugby and general laddery is doomed to a marriage without fun and games as Meghan Markle reveals she is a social justice warrior feminist. There will be no more rugby games, or footie, just indoctrination into the pseudo-Marxist SJW race-baiting agenda by his new mullato wife, who is a member of BLM and undoubtably has a very large chip on her shoulder, ready to trigger the race card at any moment. Colonial artefacts purged from Queen’s palaces The new member of the royal family, Meghan Markle also wants anything that shows Britain’s colonial past to be scrapped, including the Crown Jewels which have diamonds seized from former colony, India. “I have been to Balmoral, and the Tower of London where the Queen keeps her Crown jewels. These are remnants of an Imperial colonial time in which Britain stole from countries and gave nothing back. I will make it my mission to change the royal family forever, and will demand they repatriate all of these stolen items to their former homes,” Markle shouted decisively at a courtier today. The IQ challenged Prince realised the mistake he has made only today, after he was brutally scolded for watching highlights of the FA Cup final on telly. His American bride does not condone any form of laddish behaviour and to see the prince sitting on the sofa with a beer in his hand watching the match re-run infuriated her SJW Marxist feminist sensibilities. Any form of sport, is deemed as masculine and against emasculating feminine sensibilities. “Everywhere I go in these palaces, all I see are antiquities and jewellery stolen from colonial lands. I am disgusted by it all. Also, there will be no hunting. I understand the royals like to hunt animals. I will put my foot down and disallow them from carrying on with it, and if they don’t stop I will be on the phone to PETA (an American organisation against animal cruelty),” Markle added. There will thus be no more hijinks and laddery from poor old Prince Harry, who has now been consigned to the mortuary slab of politically correct SJW death after marrying the American whose sole agenda is to castrate the royal family, and change them into something they definitely are not.

It was a total amusing embarrassment to everyone, including black people, as this guy basically took over everything and pushed the race card down peoples’ throats proclaiming some sort of racial success over whitey. This was an Al Sharpton wet dream come true. First off, Meghan is a mulatto, she is not even full black. If she was, Harry would not be seen five hundred yards near her. These idiots think things have changed. It is hundred percent certain that behind safe closed doors they certainly have not, especially when it comes to the royals,” one of the revellers at the after wedding party revealed. These were all exotic curiosities The Bishop, would have even made James Brown cringe at his virtue signalling racist display, because all he was doing was saying that blacks had now infiltrated the pure bloods, and that black supremacy was well on the way to becoming a reality. Nothing has changed What these people do not understand is that humans today, especially the royal family, are essentially the same as people who lived thousands of years ago, with the same foibles and discriminatory outlook. Nothing will ever change humanity, and its general makeup. Nothing.

Numbers come up in everything we do, whether it’s the lottery ticket you bought last night, or that pesky bill that dropped on your welcome mat this morning. Numbers can dictate whether you get that A grade or just a plain old B in your Chemistry exam, and numbers can dictate whether your favourite football team gets that much needed win. From the Ancient Sumerians who invented most of the mathematics we use today, or the Ancient Greek mathematicians like Pythagoras, humanity’s understanding of numbers is a constantly evolving quantum ladder of infinite numerical madness. Lest we forget about the significance of the correlation of words and numbers, with Gemetria, an Assyro-Babylonian-Greek system of alphanumeric code or cipher that assigns numerical value to a word, name, or phrase in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other. A single word can yield multiple values depending on the system used. In Hebrew gematria the word chai (alive), is composed of two letters that add up to eighteen. This has made eighteen a “lucky number” among the Jewish people. Gifts of money in multiples of eighteen are very popular. So, what makes a number particularly favourable? Again, this is purely subjective and random as well? You may say the number seven is your lucky number. Why? Well in your own personal view it is a number that comes up a lot, and it works for you. There are cultural differences, nuances to favourable and unfavourable numbers. In Chinese buildings the number four, thirteen, and fourteen are always omitted because they are considered unlucky, especially as the Cantonese word for four sounds like the word for ‘death’. If you live in London, you know for certain that if you’re waiting for a bus for forty minutes in the freezing rain, you will often get three buses all come at the same time, that’s just ‘sod’s law’ but it does make you think about numbers all the same. After your third wife and divorce, is number four going to be much of the same? Should you eat that second cream cake or go that extra ten miles on the exercise bike? Music is dictated by numbers. Check out that George Clinton Parliament groove on P-Funk that comes down on the three. Is there funk after death? Seven Up! Bach, of course is the king of numbers, as his compositions read like a mathematical maze of supreme universal symmetrical order. Sean Connery, an avid casino goer always betted on the number seventeen on the roulette table. One can almost picture the scene in the Casino de la Vallee in Saint-Vincent, Italy, in 1963, when Connery won on the number seventeen three times in a row. No doubt, for the best Bond actor, this was 007 melting into a real-life scenario. The odds for him to pull off that win were 1:50653, picking up a cool 17 million lire in winnings. Everything is about numbers, and if that certain lucky one turns up giving you a win it makes those endorphins rush through your system. In the world of games, casinos, computer games, lotteries, and life, then you will be counting on that certain number for the rest of your life. In a recent survey conducted by Betway Casino, the UK’s luckiest numbers were revealed, providing insight into which numbers bring people in Britain the most good fortune in their lives. The survey asked more than 2,000 members of the British public about their numerical superstitions. Results here. Remember folks, it’s all a numbers game, whatever you’re doing.'], ['Brexit: “Screw Ireland Build 200 Foot High Border Wall”', "Theresa May's Remainer Brexit Britain -- Not even fit for the knackers yard The Remainer PM, Theresa May, who could not negotiate her way out of a paper bag, is a lacklustre wet drip with no fucking balls or desire to free Britain from the octopus grip of the EU with a real Brexit as voted by the people. Mrs. May has again capitulated for the umpteenth time to demands from not only the EU but now Ireland, an EU controlled country now led by an Indian homosexual PM, who prefers picking pansies in his boutique garden to making any sort of common sense negotiations. Thanks to the Remainer insipid PM, Britain is now tied to the EU for god knows how long with the so-called Customs-Union and Single Market. This means that International trade deals are now postponed indefinitely, and the whole premise of Brexit is non-existent. You can hear the traitorous Remainers on big bank busting EU pension plans and Brussels handouts laughing joyously as Britain is sold down the river once again, the people trodden on, democracy now a long distant memory. For these people, these traitors, these vile scum sucking Remainers who willingly wipe their arses on the British flag for money and hatred of their own nation, this is a definite win for them. What this means is that the ‘will of the people’ means nothing in Britain today. Democracy does not exist in Britain. All those promises before the EU Referendum that the vote would be final, would be legally binding and a true measure of the democratic will of the people — it was all a big fucking lie. The people have been lied to, dragged through the dirt, their vote usurped, spit on and defiled. The sovereign right for Britain to rule itself, make its own rules, make its own trade deals on its own terms, control its own borders, are all a dream of the past. For thousands of years these islands have always made their own destiny, but today that is all gone, we as an island are now ruled comprehensively by others from foreign lands who are milking us monetarily and do not care one fig about us. Britain is effectively a beaten country, ruled by traitors, sold off for the lowest price to foreign powers for a pittance. Remainers spit on the graves of those who died in the two great wars to bring Britain freedom. They scowl at the graves, pull down their trousers and literally shit on the graves of those soldiers who gave their lives for Britain. Remainers are the evil face of pure hatred and greed, their avarice fuelled by unelected members of the EU Commission and their handouts in brown envelopes delivered to these quisling Remainers in dark back alleys. Lord Haw Haw would be proud today at Remainers and the House of Lords, who betrayed Britain, sold us off to the enemy with no fucking way of getting out. And all of this happened under the gaze of so-called Brexiteers in Cabinet and parliament. Brexiteers, who were meant to defend democracy, and the will of the people yet did nothing…they were impotent. They postulated of course, we will do this, we will do that, but they had no fucking balls to do anything, too afraid of losing their positions in government or parliament. Not one of them stood up for Britain, there was no sacrificial Charge of the Light Brigade cry as they ran towards the enemy, they just stood by and watched, powerless, creatures with not one single fucking bollock between them, a vomitous menage of losers, braced with yellow piss coloured cowardice. One must therefore assume the so-called Brexiteers in parliament are in cahoots with the Remainers, that is the only conclusion to come to, and it is a sad detrimental conclusion that ultimately reveals the truth about this whole Brexit farce. Fuck You No one should dictate to Britain what it can and cannot do. Britain dictates to others, not the other way round. Ireland and its demands are thus rendered impotent, because Ireland is a land ruled by the EU, they are a beaten country, a land which has already been conclusively beaten and defeated by Brussels. Fuck you. You are now worthless, you are not Ireland anymore, you are something else, you are lower than dirt, a defeated people with no self worth or national pride. Build a 200 ft high steel wall across the infected border with Northern Ireland, man it with turrets and electric fences to make a successful Brexit.

Paradigm Shit Palace courtiers were not too happy with Russell Brand after the show aired but have kept a stony dignified silence over the whole affair. There is speculation however that not only is Prince Harry not happy about Brand’s declaration but Prince Philip literally blew off his colostomy bag upon hearing the news. The Forgetting Sarah Marshall star, who portrayed rocker Aldous Snow in the 2010 flop, went on to imitate someone objecting to Meghan’s and Prince Harry‘s highly-anticipated royal wedding on Saturday. “Meghan Markle, there we go. ‘If anyone has any reason …’” teased Brand before adding, “Yeah! Russell Brand snogged her in a film, then took her up the Greek afterwards!’ Never mind her bloody dad selling photos!” he said referring to the news that Markle’s dad participated in staged paparazzi photos. Members of the public were not too happy about Brand’s words either.

It would be an honour for me to walk the soon-to-be princess down the church aisle,” President Trump said from the White House. Donald Trump, ever the diplomat, has recently been persuading Kim Jong-un to drop his nuclear armaments, that is until that John Bolton idiot stuck his fat nose into everything and fucked it all up.

He said one sample proved positive for the deadly Ebola virus. Ilunga said Congo now is entering an urban phase of the outbreak, with higher spread potential. He said epidemiologists are working to identify additional contacts to the 500 already identified. Lessons not learned One would have thought the people and authorities in Congo would have learned that the eating of bushmeat is a cause of the spread of Ebola, but many have not heeded any warnings. Bushmeat is still a staple diet of many Africans, even though there is solid scientific evidence proving that deadly pathogens are spread into the human population from ingesting bushmeat. In the Congo, bushmeat consists of monkeys, crocodiles, antelope, snakes, gorillas and bats. Bats carry highly infectious pathogens and are one of the primary causes of the spread of Ebola. Bushmeat is considered an African delicacy Photo: C. Stanley/Flickr With international travel, and a steady flow of traffic from the Congo to Europe and other destinations, it is only a matter of time until the spread of any infectious tropical virus like Ebola spreads. The symptoms are not seen for some time once infected, 21 days is the usual incubation period. This is why it is easy to take a flight to Paris, France from the Congo with no problems. During the flight, the infected passenger may infect many more passengers simply through a sneeze or cough. Water droplets carry the virus with little effort, and the victim ingests the droplets either through the nasal passage, mouth or even pores in the skin. Thanks to the EU Schengen zone, the spread of Ebola throughout the European peninsula would be quite quick unless contained early. Already, many illegal migrants from Congo, Eritrea, and other parts of Africa make their way towards the crossing from Libya onto Italy. It is safe to say that Italy would become ground zero during a major Ebola outbreak as the number of migrants making the treacherous crossing in boats is rising daily. The Ebola virus is transmitted by bodily fluids, and even after being cured, the virus exists in semen for three months, therefore it can be transmitted far and wide. Death from Ebola is usually extremely painful as the internal organs are eaten away and massive internal bleeding occurs shutting down the whole system.'], ['World Cup 2018 Russian Festival of Brutal Violence a Death Sentence', 'Russian ultras are getting ready for England fans for the World Cup in Russia this summer. No one in their right mind should go to Russia, especially after what happened at the Euro 2016 football hooligan event in Marseilles. Russian Ultras do not drink alcohol before fighting events and are highly trained in fighting arts like Krav Maga, Russian Systema and other Spetsnaz fighting techniques. Backed directly by Putin’s Kremlin, Russian Ultras are also highly organised during fighting sessions, overwhelming their opponents, then taking them down clinically, and brutalising them mercilessly even when down on the ground helpless. Russian Ultras wear all black clothing, black hats and have specific legions, they meticulously plan their attacks utilising maps before each football event. They mark out areas where they will flank their opponents, planning strafing attacks as well as where they can corner their opponents and beat them senseless. England fans have many major weaknesses, they are unorganised, untrained, and are usually drunk. These qualities are capitalised on by the Russians who utilise military techniques, and the fact that English fans are drunk and disorganised to maximum effect. The Russians will be fully sober of alcohol, although on amphetamines, and pure adrenaline. Not only do the Russian Ultras have highly advanced attack formations and plans, but they also utilise sophisticated techniques to avoid any police contact. This means they can inflict as much damage as possible on England fans without reproach or fear of getting caught. Usually, this means many England fans are caught unaware, as the Russians appear out of nowhere and smash their opponents with ultimate brutality and no mercy, then swiftly dissapear. It is certainly interesting that the Home Office has not called off the World Cup in Russia this summer for England fans, as they will be prime targets, especially after the recent Novichock chemical attack in Salisbury. It is safe to say, therefore that England fans will be sitting ducks during the Russian World Cup and their lives will be in serious danger. The heavily trained Russian Ultras have been training hard in the gym and their special training camps for this specific event all year. The Russian Ultra creed this summer is to show its superiority, and brutal might over the drunk, fat, untrained English fans and if any England fans actually go to the Russian World Cup, they might just as well be coming back in a body bag.'], ['UKGC is Fighting Gambling Operators with Big Fines', 'W hen we think about the world of online gambling, we can think that this is a bit of a shady industry.

This allows them to put stops in place, effectively suspending their account for a set period of time. This can be temporary, for a month, or permanent – depending on what the player feels is appropriate. During this time, the operator has some serious obligations to the player. They have to treat this player differently, as they have flagged that they have an issue with gambling. Problem gambling is a serious issue and one that operators have to respect and stamp out where possible. This means that they can’t communicate with the player to offer them promotions or attempt to have them coming back before their exclusionary period is up. The failings of LeoVegas include marketing to these excluded players, allowing them to gamble and not taking reasonable steps to support them. They were also found to be running ads that were deemed to be misleading. These were misleading due to extensive terms that were not represented or claims that were embellished. The result of this ruling was a £627,000 fine for the entertainment site, which was deemed to be the rough amount of profit accrued due to these business practices. 888’s £7.8million Fine One of the largest fines that we’ve ever seen handed down by the UKGC is the £7.8million bill delivered to 888. This was on similar grounds to the previous one levied against LeoVegas, for failings relating to self-exclusion. As a much larger operator, it makes sense that they have a much bigger fine to pay. More than 7000 of their excluded players were impacted by these failings. These players were still able to access their account and place bets, even after submitting their desire to exclude. This is a serious flaw within the self-exclusion system and for such a large operator it’s not an acceptable flaw to have. From there, it was also found that one of their players was able to place bets amounting to £1.3million without any form of checks. Operators are responsible for checking in on players spending habits, to ensure that they are playing with their own money and in a responsible fashion. This player had actually stolen this money from their employer and potential action from 888 could have mitigated this. The money that has been fined by the UKGC was found to be the profits from these players and will be used to fund problem gambling charities. 888 are now working with the government body to produce a sturdier self-exclusion system going forward. Systematic Failures from William Hill Another big name operator, William Hill, has also been fined over the course of the last year. They have been fined a total of £6.2million because of what the UKGC are calling ‘systematic failures’. Money laundering is a serious concern for operators, as they have a responsibility to know their players to prevent this from happening. Online gambling can be a funnel for those looking to launder money from illegal activities. As the money paid in and out of online gambling sites can be volatile, it’s an easy way to move cash around from illegal activities. The onus is on the operator to be able to assess where the money is coming from and identifying players to investigate further. Ten of their customers were able to deposit over £1.2million, which was later found to be linked to criminal activity. This was deemed to be unacceptable by the UKGC, as they effectively allowed these illegal funds to be legitimised through their platform. In their eyes, William Hill should have taken steps to query where these funds were coming from on such high stakes wagers. Next Steps for the UK Gambling Industry This seems to be indicative of an overall trend within the industry, as more operators are taken to task over these issues. Socially responsible operators like Lucky Admiral are paving the way by taking steps to ensure that they are compliant. For many operators, it makes sense to attempt to create this kind of safety net by taking their own steps to be better, rather than waiting for a fine to be handed down. In the wake of GDPR, these sites will also have to think about how they handle player data too. This is a massive undertaking for any gambling site, as they potentially have millions of player profiles. It can also be somewhat contradictory with the rights of self-excluded players. Although they can ask for their data to be removed, operators would still have to retain enough information to prevent them from gambling with them again. We’ve also seen a lot of emphasis placed on underage gambling. These underage players can also be failed by the system, as they should be assessed prior to being able to gamble. This includes ID checks and flagging up fraudulent information. We’re also seeing a sizeable reduction in the number of sites using cartoon mascots, as these have also been deemed by the CAP as attractive to underage gamblers. We may see more fines on the way for sites that aren’t placing enough checks for these players. The UK gambling market is becoming tougher for operators, as the UKGC proposes more rules and regulations. It seems that conscious operators will be able to change their processes to stay compliant, those that don’t will be at risk of a fine.'], ['Man: “Latest Boston Dynamics Robots Scare the Shit Outta Me”', 'The future does not need us humans, and sometimes this feeling gets closer and closer to reality. Hail, the age of the robots is upon us. Watching the latest robots from Boston Dynamics (a former Google owned company) and the uncanny human movements they have acquired will truly make the hairs on your neck stand up. The incredible technology is so advanced that this company has truly excelled beyond any other research development company on earth today. Every day is one small step towards the Kurzweil Singularity, and one can imagine this coupled with advanced AI, and we have the recipe right there. “I saw these robots and I shrunk into myself. It’s truly uncanny, scary to see such machine robots jumping and running around as if they were human or some kind of devilish animal. I can’t help thinking of these robots tracking humans down, their onboard weapons aided by heat seeking vision,” a man said after seeing the videos. Could we all be walking towards a dystopian robot nightmare or will these robots serve humans obediently? That is the question many ask, and it is certainly a pertinent question to be ruminating over. Imagine running through a dark forest being chased by twenty of these things. You are out of breath but they never tire, you are fearful, but they have no feelings as they close in on you, their metal fangs and red eyes glow in the dark. You trip over a tree stump, their night vision allows them to jump over it with ease, until you are cornered, out of breath, the last thing you hear is the whirring motors as the pack rips you apart, limb from limb.'], ['ROYAL EXCLUSIVE: When Prince Harry Met the In-Laws', 'Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are soon to be wed, and as Meghan has met the Windsor family already, it was Prince Harry’s turn to meet the soon to be in-laws. The prince travelled to deepest Montana three weeks ago to meet some members of the Markle clan and Doobey clan, as well as their extended family. Speaking on an ITV exclusive, the prince was truly humbled after meeting some of the family. Welcome to the family “At one point one of them took out a vintage blunderbuss and shot a trespasser (photographer) on their land clean dead. It was quite a mess,” Prince Harry recalled jocularly. Living in a shack were the cousins from the Doobey and Markle family. Uncle Buck Doobey, 65, is a wanted felon in seven states and was convicted for illegal moonshine production in 2016. He is also an alleged sheep rapist, and is to be tried in the county court in two weeks time. Delores Markle, 42, sold her story to a New York tabloid for a six figure sum, and spilled the beans about ‘Pushy Princess Meghan’. She is set to buy a pig pen on her property with the funds she received. “Imma raise some pigs to get me rich and fat. This shit is owed to me. Hyuk!” Delores Markle, 42, points a gun at a photographer at her Montana property Enus Doobey, 28, has been in and out of prison all his short life, and is currently on the run for credit card fraud, meth dealing as well as robbing seven banks unsuccessfully in four states. “They’s told me that I might get an invite to Meghan’s wedding where they gots lots of silver and jewels and shiet. Unfortunately it never arrived in the mail. Imma have to catch that goddamn mailman next time I see the sumbitch!” Living in a shack where most of the windows are broken, there is no running water, but there’s plenty of beer and meth. “We live well here. Never worked a day in my life. Last time I saw Meg in L.A. we got on like a house on fire, that is I burned down her pa’s kitchen after a meth cooking experiment went wrong.” Enus Doobey, relaxes in his kitchen while his father Buck drinks some home made beer All in all, Prince Harry had a pleasant time on his visit to see the future in-laws, and at one point took part in a competition to see who could spit tobacco furthest. The ITV special on the royal visit will air in July.'], ['Tech Experts Leaving Google Over Lucrative but ‘Evil’ Pentagon Military Contract', 'The military contract named Project Maven which teaches machine learning AI to killer drones over countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan is now a part of the Google roster of contracts. It is most certainly the brainchild of Eric Schmidt who now is working full-time for the Pentagon after leaving Google as CEO. Don’t be evil One employee said: “I joined Google because they said they weren’t evil, well, that shit did not work out. The mass censorship of alternative media, global search monopoly, authoritarian control of search results to skew public opinion, leftist agendas and now a military contract helping drones blow up brown people living in countries we hate because they’re not American or Christian. It was the last straw. Like, yesterday, I was ordered to clean up Sundar Pichai’s hole in the floor toilet in his office. He’s Indian and cannot stand Western toilets. He does not even use toilet paper but uses his bare left had to wipe like a good Indian, sometimes he forgets to wash his left hand. Indians use their naked left hand to wipe their asses and their right to eat with. Can you imagine the bugs he’s spreading at the canteen during lunch? Like what the fuck? I refused and walked out.” Whether Indian Google CEO Sundar Pichai uses his country’s customs is not the point here however, and the main issue is about Project Maven and its erroneous uses to murder unwitting people by American drones. Unfortunately many civilians die during these U.S. drone strikes, and in one instance 41 men were targeted, but 1,147 innocent civilians were killed. Ethically, apart from the massive censorship that Google doles out, as well as its dislike of satire, possibly because it just does not understand it, there is a serious ethical question to Google’s participation in the Pentagon’s Project Maven. Meanwhile, thousands of tech experts are resigning from Google because of this particular ethical question.'], ['Trump Hails Success of Jerusalem American Embassy Massacre – Only 98 Dead', 'President Donald J. Trump today hailed another mission accomplished after the successful opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem. “The Israelis only killed 98 Palestinians during the opening ceremony. That’s quite a success in my eyes because there were thousands of these indigenous shitheads around. I’m actually surprised the number of deaths was not higher.” Trump’s beautiful daughter, Ivanka, stood by the plaque for the new embassy as arms flailed in the air, at one point she was hit by a dismembered foot but her smile did not flinch at any point during the opening ceremony. A bystander who lost both legs during the American embassy opening ceremony was okay about it, and just notched it under slight bad luck. “I was standing in the crowd clapping when the bullets started flying and IDF soldiers told us to disperse. I held up my invitation slip but the soldier unloaded a magazine or three of bullets into my legs practically disintegrating them. I’m thankful I got to keep my scrotum although the rest is all gone. Oh well, I’m happy about the U.S. embassy and wish many more years of fun and games,” Lionel Majinski, recalled from his Jerusalem hospital bed. Jerusalem officials have revealed it may take a few days to wash away the blood and dismembered body parts from around the embassy and other areas but other than that everything worked like clockwork on the day.'], ['Meghan and Harry to Honeymoon in Hawaii', 'The soon to be wedded couple are said to have their eye on the Hawaiian island of kilauea for their multimillion pound taxpayer funded honeymoon. Royal commentator Bartholomew Bentwick, revealed the news in the latest edition of Hello magazine. “The prince likes volcanoes because they are dangerous much like marrying a ‘dime princess’ a la Wally Simpson. Meghan is certainly not a 19th century ‘dollar princess‘ the debt-ridden royals welcomed so eagerly to bolster their coffers and heat their palaces back in the day.” Staying at the Leilani Estates 5 star hotel, the royal couple will get a first hand look at the lava as it flows decisively across the immaculate gardens towards the hotel. Prince Harry has refused to sign a pre-nup before the wedding and is most certainly to get a short sharp eruption of his own in a few years time. “Prince Harry is used to different women every day. They are served up to him daily in secrecy of course, but there’s no way he will be able to cope with one piece of pussy for the rest of his life. It’s just impossible. Harry usually loses interest after a few hours. I mean if you can taste all of the different kinds, and not have any blowback, he will go positively insane after the first few months, and then there’s the babies, when the mother is with them it’s all over. This will certainly cause some friction for the fiery red haired gentleman, and his very clever wife, who will no doubt cry foul after finding out, cha ching!” one of Harry’s mates revealed candidly. As for marrying a commoner, these are never accepted by the aristocracy. Of course aristocrats are armed with friendly smiles and Meghan will not notice what is going on but Harry certainly will. This is why Hawaii is such a prescient honeymoon destination for the newlywed royal couple.'], ['3 online cost-effective ways to market your business', 'A business that finds itself on the first or second page of the Google search results is likely to succeed than the one which finds itself on page 5 or 10. As such, having and maintaining a strong online presence is a key component to the success of a business; this task, however, does not come easy nor cheap. While it’s certain that you have to spend some money looking for a digital marketing agency, you can find solace in that there is an affordable digital marketing agency that offers cost-effective ways to market your business. Blogging One of the proven ways to keep in touch with your customers is through blogging. Different marketing agencies are capable of blogging focusing on any particular niche. Blogging can take many forms i.e. you can use the blog to promote new services or products, inform your customers about the benefits of your products, and use it as a platform to answer in detail to questions raised by your customers. In order to realise the maximum potential of a blog, you need to update the blog regularly meaning you need to establish a long-term relationship with a marketing agency. Invest in a strong social media presence Studies show that many people nowadays spend much of their time on social media channels rather than browsing company websites. This means you have a better chance of reaching more people using your business’ different social media handles than the business website itself. There are many social media platforms, each with its own pros and cons for different businesses. Facebook is perfect for businesses that want to send text and graphical messages to its customers in equal proportion. Twitter and LinkedIn are perfect for businesses that want to send text messages only to its customers while Instagram and Pinterest are perfect for businesses that want to show the graphical side mostly. Tap into the possibilities of YouTube and Flickr Social media channels mostly offer you the opportunity to send simple messages to your customers but these may not be enough. To attract many people, you need not just send out a simple text or image ad the summarises what your business has to offer but you may need to come up with videos that explain in detail what it is you can do for the customer. Sites such as YouTube and Flickr give you the room and platform to interact with customers while showing your work. The videos need not be too long, as that’s a turn off for some rather they should be short and concise touching on the most important parts. Types of videos that you can do depending on your line of business include explainer videos where you explain how your product works or how you provide your services, Q&A videos where you answer customer questions, and How to’s/Tutorials where you educate your customers on how to use your products.'], ['Henry Kissinger: “The Delightful Drums of War Beat Louder Every Day”', 'The prophesy the Daily Squib published in 2011 is slowly coming into fruition, as espoused by the venerable Henry Kissinger, possibly the greatest living statesman of modern times. Now that the future prophesy is becoming a reality we had to pick Henry’s brains just a little more to possibly see the real clincher in how the whole chess game will pan out. Once again we were afforded a brief interview with the elderly statesman in his grand Manhattan apartment, and after a long journey from London, England, we were greeted with the utmost hospitality from our host. Kissinger for his age looks remarkably well, of course he has the stoop, and lumbers over to an exquisite Louis XVI chair humming a jovial tune, but his mind is still a tour de force to be reckoned with. Kissinger’s nurse, Hilda, hands over some fine brandy, and we get started. Kissinger speaks with a gentle lulling voice. “In our last conversation I spoke of the key to war. This key is Iran, and its catalyst was Iraq and Syria. One must remember that a conflict with Iran is effectively a conflict with Russia and China, and soon they will enter the fray, as was prophesied. We, the United States have been baiting the Russians and Chinese for some time, and slowly they are getting the message. They will be forced to make their move sooner than later. The supreme land of Eretz Ha’Avot, our motherland, our home will fight with all its might now to cleanse the Middle East of threats to Israel. This is the time to cut out the tumour that has haunted us for so long, and Bibi, my protégé, will take no prisoners. Rest assured, I was on the phone to him yesterday during the Iranian attack on the Golan Heights.” I ask Kissinger, in the last conversation we had in 2011, he was quoted as saying “It is just that last stepping stone, i.e. Iran which will really tip the balance”. Why is Iran such a stepping stone for total global warfare? Kissinger pauses for a few seconds, then rasps quietly, yet forcibly. “The Persians are the ultimate prize in global hegemony. Once that line is crossed, then the onus and power play increases incrementally. The stepping stone to global domination ever closer for the United States. Iran is bolstered by Russia and China, and when we take that away from them, they will have less global power, they will have less global brinkmanship, they will see reduced global territorial influence in the region. This will cause them to make a move, because if they do not, then they are finished as well as the Iranians. “When General Wesley Clarke said that seven Middle Eastern countries were to be taken over, he was not joking or fooling around. This is the plan all along, and the internet is helping the spread of Western culture, Western ways, that these countries aspire to be like the West, especially when every day they see how we live very well in the West. Their poverty, their uncertain living standards, their constant state of war for them becomes unbearable. The people will also eventually revolt from the inside to dethrone the dictators. Look what happened in Libya, in Egypt and Tunisia, now in Yemen, and Syria, Iraq as well as the failed coup in Turkey. Hearts and minds first, then military.” I ask Dr. Kissinger about Obama’s style of presidency compared to Trump’s. You cannot make an omelette without breaking a few eggs “Essentially one was the sweetener before the cup of coffee. Obama’s role, and he played it very well was to sweeten up the chumps, and to think they had one over us. Naturally, Obama did not know that was his role, and he naively believed he was doing the right thing. However, we would never give in so easily, and this is why we put Trump in. Once we had the sweetener, we put in the cup of war, the coffee, strong and military trained of course, as Trump is, he went to military academy and knows what is needed. He knows that business is war, war is business, and he also knows that to really finish the job, we must have total war or nothing will ever change. You cannot make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, thus meaning — for true change to come, we must first have some constructive destruction. The moment of truth will be beautiful to behold, because war is both things, it is ugly yet beautiful in what it can achieve.” Did Dr. Kissinger know about the EU army, and its preparations for war with Russia in 2011? I ask the esteemed gentleman that question. “Yes, of course I knew. Yes, Russia has always been a thorn in Europe’s side, and the recent incursion into Ukraine was a small but decisive move by Putin. Here is a man that I respect highly because he acts decisively, yet secretively, almost akin to a grandmaster in chess, but we will always outmanoeuvre him with our technology, our technique, and we will outmanoeuvre the Chins too. We shackled them with communism in the first place, therefore they have their hands tied behind their backs and are literally too blind to see straight with their restrictive ideology. The Russians however have gone from communism to authoritarianism and vast amounts of mafia corruption, I might add. The Russians are still in a post-Soviet stupor, they have still not found themselves. As for Europe, they are in a sclerotic state as the drums of war are beating ever faster and louder every day.” By this time, Kissinger is getting tired, his head lilts slightly forward, and some spittle drools onto his dressing gown. The nurse quickly applies a handkerchief to his jowls, and I am permitted the final question for the session. I ask Dr. Kissinger about the New World Order that will come after the purging is completed. What will that entail? “Most of it, I cannot talk about, and I may not live to even see it, however as one of its architects, I can reveal a few slivers of information. Essentially the NWO means singular. There can only be one winner over all of earth’s last remaining resources, and no other factions can exist. It also means a controlled population below 500 million where no other conflict will ever occur again. Invariably, the new technological society is in place now, because we have the technology and technique as we speak now, but the inherent problem is different factions, old ways of thinking and overpopulation. Of course, this is a very large topic, and I fear I have given away too much, but you do the math. If you survive into the next stage, you will be a truly esteemed member and honoured, illuminated fellow of the New World Order, but only if you survive.” It is with those last words, that Kissinger dismisses us, possibly for the last time. We leave him by the grand fireplace amongst his books and brandy. As I leave, I kick myself, as I did not ask him specifically how to survive through the next stage, but then remember the 2011 interview where he gave a few clues. Do you really have to be a billionaire to survive the next stage? I think to myself. Of course not, if you know how to survive, and are prepared, stocked up, anyone can do it, but you just have to get on with it as time really is running out. There are still many unanswered questions. I never asked about Trump’s supposed successes with North Korea, or about Brexit. Time was way too short, and I kick myself for only delving into a few topics. The trip back to London is hauntingly lonely.'], ['Obama Family Purchase New Home in Tehran Iran After Trump Destroys Nuke Deal', 'The outraged Obamas are to flee their Washington premises after Barack Hussein Obama’s legacy is in tatters thanks to President Donald Trump. “I remember that talk I did about Twitter nasty remarks, and how I said Donald Trump would never be president, and at least I was ‘a president’. It haunts me in my dreams now. Everywhere I look and hear the Donald, and he got me big time, not only did he become president, but in a short time he has done more than I ever did. My socialist Marxist dreams of a changed America are now in ruins as nearly all my efforts have been dismantled. And then he went and ruined the Iranian deal I made…I think I need to cry,” former president Obama told a recent reportage on CNN. Real estate company, Younir has confirmed the purchase of an apartment in the Sahebgharaniyeh district, Tehran by the Obamas. An upcoming high end residential area of the city where embassy staff and ministers own properties. To put into perspective the anger that emanates now from the Obamas, it’s way up there, over 170% over the boiling point. “Our family have purchased a property in Tehran, Iran where we will live. Our daughters will attend an Iranian university and are already taking lessons in Farsi,” Barack Obama later revealed. Michelle Obama and the two daughters are also getting used to wearing full head scarves as is required by women in public. “Michael, ahem, I mean Michelle, will be wearing a full head dress over her head. It’s like some Islamic custom that she is required to wear that in public,” one of the Obama aides revealed. The only problem is that in Iran homosexuality is punished with death, but of course that should not be any problem for Barack and Michelle Obama. '], ['Nothing but Fair Play: Measuring the Success of Top Online Gaming Operators in the UK', 'T he online gaming industry was launched a little over two decades ago and has moved to dethrone the brick and mortar business to become the dominant revenue generator. The wide web has successfully achieved reaching millions of gamblers by taking the location-based services to the gamer rather than having them look for the services. This convenience has been further accomplished through the introduction of mobile gaming. This platform allowed gamblers to enjoy the services of online gaming software developers and gambling destinations at the convenience of any location and a cheaper and less bulky situation than that of personal computers. On top of animating nearly all the sets found in land-based casinos, the platform has been able to replicate the experience of a location-based casino by providing live gaming platform. That way, players can enjoy live roulette UK, blackjack, poker, baccarat, and others in Realtime and with other gamblers. The success of the online gambling platform has catalysed the significant rise in gaming operators that are looking to satisfy the ever-growing online gambling fan base. Most of the sites that have been established have only accomplished half of what is required to run a business on the online platform. Below we look into the second part of this process, which is measuring the success of gaming operators in the United Kingdom. Use of Key Performance Indicators When it comes to being successful in the online gaming scene, or any other business for that matter, the marketing of products being provided plays a key role. Marketing not only involves getting clients to try out the product but also keep them coming back for more once they have. Different gaming entities have varying methods as to how they achieve this, but one that stands out among all of them is the provision of bonuses and promotions. In a bid to earn the loyalty of as many players as possible, casino operators end up spending a lot. With the amount of money pumped into the marketing venture, most gaming establishments would want to know how to measure whether they are achieving success or not, especially considering that the business exists on a virtual platform: this is where Key Performance Indicators, better known as KPIs, come in. Key Performance Indicators involve various algorithms that help casinos understand the relation between the gamblers they have and the money flowing in and out of their casino; the final figures are then used to measure success. The first important part of this algorithms is the Gross Gaming Revenue. This part helps tell the difference between the wagers placed on the provided games and the wins collected by gamblers. The amount generated varies from one time to the other considering that most casino games are dependent on luck; therefore, gamers may collect more wins some days and lose more on others. The reached value includes the bills to be paid by the gaming establishment. Once that is done, the Net Gaming Revenue comes in. This algorithm indicates the amount casino operators are left with after they have cleared out all the casino bills; these may range from one casino to the next, but the most popular ones include: Government taxes Cashier options charges Game developer fees Affiliates’ commissions License Charges Incentives provided to gamblers, etc. Net Gross Revenue can also be calculated to the amount of money cashed in by gamblers. The higher the value, the higher the success rate. However, the cashed in amount to wagers placed should not be high, or this would indicate that too much money is going back to the gamblers; this could most likely be in the form of bonuses and promotion offers. Gaming operators should also put into consideration the amount that is spent to draw in each gambler when measuring how successful they are. For instance, if ten thousand dollars were used when marketing the site through advertisements, which resulted in the acquisition of one hundred gamblers, each gamer cost the casino one hundred dollars. The casino should calculate to see whether each of these players brought in more than what was used to acquire them to see if the venture was a success. The KPIs can be used to measure success in terms of gamblers as well as cash. For instance, they can be used to calculate the number of gamers that created an account with the gaming establishment against those that actually paid the site a visit. Success comes in when the percentage acquired is high since it means a lot of them were interested in what they saw and spent some money; those that made the move to spend some money should be the key factor in this equation. Additionally, one can move on to evaluate how many gamblers stayed loyal to the gaming site against those that left after only a short while. Again, this percentage should be high to indicate success. Even those that come back should be measured according to the amount of time and money that they spend playing. Seeing from the number of KPIs that are involved in the measurement of success and the number of gamers that could visit a site, it can prove hard to keep track of everything manually. Various software programs are availed online to calculate the success rates and provide them when needed. Above all, gaming operators should be keen on providing client satisfaction above all for the success rate to be high at all times.'], ['Cold war in the Sauna – An Honest Opinion From a Russian American', 'Big Almaty lake In December. Kazakhstan. I had just finished exercising and went to the sauna. The gym I go to is a modern facility with new equipment and is very popular in our city. My favorite parts are the sauna and the steamer. Both remind me of my old country – Russia. Though, to be politically and geographically correct – I never lived in Russia: I was born and raised in one of the fifteen republics of the former USSR – the republic of Kazakhstan. So, I am a Russian from Kazakhstan. It’s kind of confusing for Americans, and when twenty-six years ago my American wife brought me here, the customs official gave me an alien card where my nationality was stated not Russian but Kazakh. My friends make fun of me, because Russians and Kazakhs are like apples and oranges. We look different… In 1992, when I arrived in America, the relationship between the two cold war rivals was excellent: Americans traveled to Russia, opening McDonalds, KFC’s, Burger Kings, and other businesses, and Russians were opening not only their hearts but even the secrets of the overthrown KGB. Millions of Russians and Americans enjoyed such a “romance” between the two most powerful nuclear countries in the world. Not anymore! Every morning I wake up to the words, “Russia is terrible,” and go to sleep with the humiliating jokes of the “night-show-clowns” about “the dictator” Putin and “barbaric” Russians, whose 13 hackers changed the electoral minds of millions of naïve Americans. Wow! What a powerful “gasoline station country”- Russia, as Senator McCain calls it. If in 1992 the people in my city who heard my accent were very nice to me and to Russia, now the usual reaction is to stare at me like a goat at the newly painted gates. One of my neighbors even yelled at me when I answered his question about my recent trip to Russia. I told him: “Russians like Putin because he saved their country from collapse. I saw with my own eyes how Russia has changed since my last trip there. I didn’t see the impact of Obama’s sanctions, Russians have better roads, than we have in Colorado; the shops, are filled with all kinds of products; the churches are restored…” My neighbor who didn’t like Trump yelled at me: “If you like Russia go back to your country!” My answer was: “I love Russia but I am American – like your immigrant wife, like you. I love America for a lot of reasons, one of them – the right to speak! Nobody should privatize this right.” He ran away, later coming to apologize… My wife, knowing my hard-tempered character asks me not to talk about policy – Putin-Trump anymore. And I don’t, to a certain degree. However, when someone asks me about Russia or Putin I usually answer, giving my point of view; I just cannot be silent. I was silent for 40+ years living in the USSR, not anymore! Of course, not everyone likes my answers, like the man I am going to tell you about. So, I went into the sauna; a stout man was sitting on the upper bench. He was the same age as I. Many of the older men in America call ourselves “old farts.” The name is not offensive to us, because we really do not care about our image, and because we like to make jokes about everything, mostly about ourselves. Usually, we old farts are nice, we love to talk, even in the sauna. Young people nowadays do not talk. They turn on their phones even in the sauna – I bet they do not know how to talk with other people. They cover their “secrets” in towels while we do not – we do not have any secrets anymore. Anyway, the man said hello to me, I answered, and he caught my slight accent. “Where are you from?” It’s a question I am usually asked. “From here.” I answered. He was a little confused. I knew what usually followed if I had said – “from Kazakhstan.” Usually, there would be an exchange of this type: “Where is it?” – “Between Russia and China,” – “How do you like it here?” The silly film “Borat” helped me for a short period of time. People were smiling, as if they met Sasha Cohen, and I was happy that at least they knew some geography, though the film was silly and the geography in it was completely mistaken. “No, I mean originally where are you from?” The guy, let’s call him Tony, found the right question. I decided not to check his geography skills and said that I came from Russia. The dialog that followed was remarkable. Here it is. “Welcome to America! Your English is pretty good!” “Yours, too.” He didn’t get my humor. “Just joking,” I said, “As for welcoming, it’s a little late: I have lived here for 25 years.” “Have you been in Russia lately?” He asked. “Yes, I go there every year.” “Wow. So, what do you think about that crazy guy…, Pyutin?” “Sorry, honey,” – I apologized to my wife in my thoughts and picked up the gauntlet. “You mean Putin? He is not crazy. Actually, he is one of the smartest rulers Russia ever had.” I said. Tony’s eyes nearly leaped from their sockets. “But he is a dictator and kills people!” “I wouldn’t call him a dictator – he was just last week elected by nearly 67% of Russians. I would call him an authoritarian, strong ruler; but a weak ruler in Russia wouldn’t survive a day. Besides, there were seven people opposed him in the election!” Tony smiled. “You call it an election? He chose the opponents himself from his friends. The whole world knows that elections in Russia are a sham!” “Who told you this nonsense, Tony? Did you listen to the debates? Did you hear how these people yelled at each other and cursed Putin, asking people to vote for them not for Putin. They really were as tough as Hillary to Donald! And besides, there were a lot of observers from 110 countries. They claimed the election was legitimate.” “No, I do not believe you.” “You may not believe me but I am citing the international organizations reports. You may check their reports on the Internet yourself. You may even sue these organizations if you wish.” Tony was silent for a minute, then turned his head to me and asked: “You know that Pyutin is evil even to his own people?” “You mean Putin? Who told you? How many Russians share your opinion?” “McCain.” “Is he Russian?” “No, but he knows that Pyutin is KGB.” “His name is Putin!” I tried to correct at least this in his mind. “So, you do not believe me, a Russian, who just returned from Russia, but you believe this Senator, who hates Putin and Russia? Besides, there are no KGB anymore.” “But he used to be KGB?” “Yes, and Bush H. was also a CIA agent. So, what? After the collapse of the Soviet Union there were no people who didn’t work for government in that country, we all worked for government! Putin is good for Russia, he is the brightest politician nowadays. He is like a great Chess-master, and he is a dangerous player. We must be careful with him. Some Congressmen are underestimating Russia, calling it “a gasoline station with nukes,” but I was there this summer and saw with my own eyes how much people love Putin, and how much he is doing to make that country great again.” “Yeh, yeh, yeh…” Tony didn’t know what to say. Then he recalled something and turned his red face to me. “Well, he invaded Crimea, and Ukraine!” “No, he did not. Crimea was a harbor for the Russian navy, and according to the treaty between Ukraine and Russia there were sixteen thousand Russian troops stationed there on a permanent base. There were about twenty-three thousand Ukrainian troops there, too. So, when the thugs in Kiev took power, illegally kicking out president Yanukovych and killing the political opponents, the Crimean people decided to organize a referendum. Ninety-six percent decided to reunite with Russia, as they were Russians for nearly 400 years before the Communist dictator Khrushchev gave that peninsula to Ukraine as a present to his native land.” “But they had no right to secede from the main land of Ukraine!” “Yes, they did. International law gives the right for self-determination to people. Remember, we split from the British Empire.” “But it was so long ago!” “Okay, what about East and West Germany or Kosovo? The people in these countries also exercised their right of self-determination, but they didn’t have any referendum as far as I know.” Tony looked at me attentively. “I don’t believe you.” “You have the right not to believe me. You asked, I answered.” Tony was silent for a while. Then he threw out his last argument. “I hope you wouldn’t deny that Putin killed British citizens recently, using KGB gas!” Wow, he pronounced “Putin” correctly! I smiled. The nice face of my American wife appeared in my head again, and she was not happy! I kissed her in my thoughts and finished the conversation with my last knockout blow: “I wouldn’t deny it if the poisoning by Russians had been proved!” “But it was proved by Teresa May!” “Really? What did she say?” “She said that it was Putin who poisoned the British citizens!” “Not really, my friend. She said that it was “highly likely” that Russia did it! Besides, only Mr. Skripal is a British citizen, his daughter is a Russian citizen” “Does it make any difference?” “You mean, “highly likely” is proof to punish somebody? What about one of the main pillars of democracy – innocent until proven guilty?” “But we believe our allies, not the Russians!” That statement made me laugh. “You believe not facts but political statements without any facts? Wow! What kind of democracy is that?” Tony’s face became so red that I was afraid it would melt. He stood up from the bench and without looking at me firmly said: “Russians are our enemies, and democracy does not apply to them.” He left, leaving me with a sudden fear of approaching nuclear war. At night I prayed for peace. I prayed for American and Russian people-in-power who could easily destroy this fragile planet. If people refuse to understand each other, they fight. Kennedy and Khrushchev fortunately understood this. Will Putin and Trump understand? The Daily Squib defends the right of freedom of speech from every faction, and we defend this right to the death even though we may not always agree with every opinion.'], ['Customs Union: The End is Nigh For Theresa May', 'Theresa May’s lacklustre insipid efforts towards Brexit will hopefully be shut down soon. She has sought to delay Brexit for as long as possible so that Remainers can undermine it; she has sought to tie the UK to the EU Customs Union leaving Britain with no way of making its own trade deals, she has colluded with Philip Hammond and other Remainers in thwarting Brexit at every turn whilst pretending to conduct business for the benefit of Britain leaving the EU, she and her Remainer business secretary Greg Clark have sought to bring back Project Fear to put through the ridiculous Customs Union plan. In short, if Britain has its hands tied by any form of EU Customs Union then there will effectively be no Brexit. The same goes for the Single Market, if Britain stays in, then there is no Brexit. It is now down to the ERG to do something about this debacle which has fallen upon the laps of the people who voted on June 23, 2016 to leave the EU in the EU Referendum. May must be stopped at all costs, and the rest of the Remainers purged, and demoted to the Outer Hebrides. If it was up to many Rees-Mogg would become PM, but quite rightly his stance on socialist matters is too strong, and there needs to be a PM who can appease the socialist contingent yet conduct a full on Brexit. Enter, Boris Johnson. This is what the country needs right now, and it would put the fear of god into the caterwauling treasonous Remainers and their Brussels overlords. There is no time to lose. If May persists with her idiocy, then she must be put down with no mercy. Time is running out, and once a real PM is installed, the ridiculous transitionary period can be put to bed too, along with all the other concessions Theresa May has given Brussels. She will not be missed, only remembered as the sad old grey thing that did not deliver one single thing on election promises, but instead tried to keep the UK in the EU through the backdoor.'], ['How To Choose A Reliable Essay-writing Service In UK', 'W riting services are not a surprise these days. Every student has, at least once, ordered a paper or an essay online. Writing services have become an incredibly useful tool for those, who work a lot and do not have enough time to conduct various researches. Considering the popularity of the above-mentioned services, the number of UK essay writing services is constantly growing, which makes it difficult to choose a reliable one. It is worth noting that not all of these services provide high-quality assistance. So what to do, if you need help with your paper? How to find a good writing company? Criteria For Choosing A Reputable Essay-writing Service Recommendation. One of the best ways to find a reputable writing service is to ask students, who use such resources all the time. They always have experience of ordering at various websites and can give a grounded recommendation where you should order essays and where not. Choose companies that specialise in your subject. Excellent-quality companies provide help with essays, researches and other types of academic writing but they usually indicate, which subjects they specialise in. Good writing resource cannot provide writers that specialise in all subjects and areas. If you happen to find such website, be careful, as in the end, you might receive a poorly written text. When visiting a particular writing website, pay attention to the list of subjects – they are usually specified on the main page. Writer’s qualification. The next criterion, which should be taken into consideration, is writer’s experience and qualification. Well-known and reputable writing companies pay special attention to the quality of services they provide. For this reason, they cooperate or employ only experienced writers, who have PhD or Master’s Degree. However, essay writing services do not always provide detailed information about their writers. That is why customers reviews and feedback will be helpful. You can easily find those on writing company’s website or students’ forums dedicated to similar topics. If the writer has low rating, his or her work is characterised as poor quality. Plagiarism free texts. One of the main reasons students are not using writing websites is that they are afraid of getting a text that will be disqualified by a college professor. It relates to plagiarism and not meeting academic requirements. Writing companies with profound experience are very well aware of academic requirements and make sure that all completed texts comply with these requirements. Moreover, all texts are written from scratch and undergo check for plagiarism. You should not be worried about having the same essay or paper some other student has. Deadline. Meeting deadlines is crucially important for academic curriculum and writing companies know that. This is one of criteria of defining services reputation. If a company has a record of deadline failures, you will easily find record on the Internet. When ordering a certain type of work, make sure that the writing service s able to complete assignment within indicated period of time. However, it does not mean that you should leave it for the last minute and order an essay online just two hours before the deadline. Even though most writing services accept urgent orders, their completion depends on the volume and difficulty. Order as soon as you get the assignment from your professor. Customer support. You can tell a lot by the quality of assistance provided by Customer support team. You need the essay writing company with reliable and easily reachable team as things do not always go the way we plan. If you have any difficulties placing an order, or you simply have questions regarding your order, the writing service should be able to provide you with help immediate. Try to chat with the representative of Customer support to check how quickly they process inquiries. The quicker, the better.'], ['Place your Bets: 6 Celebrities Tipped to Attend the Royal Wedding', 'Who makes the guest list for what is the premier social event royal wedding of 2018 in the UK is the subject of constant speculation. Part of the fun with royal betting is having a novelty wager or two on who will be invited to this glorious occasion, so here are six celebrities tipped to attend the ceremony. Boris Johnson While invitations to current politicians seem unlikely according to reports, nobody in that sphere typifies this Anglo-American union better than the Foreign Secretary. Boris Johnson was born in the United States and held citizenship there until 2016. He’s 2/1 to be in attendance and was Mayor of London when the city hosted the 2012 Olympic Games for which Harry was an ambassador. Serena Williams While Roger Federer joined bride-to-be Markle on this year’s 100 most influential people list published annually by Time Magazine, it’s another dominant force in modern tennis in Serena Williams that she’s good friends with. The most successful athlete on court in the Open Era in the women’s game has even had some wedding advice for Markle. Williams is 1/7 to be on the guest list. Sir Elton John Given the friendship he had with Prince Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, it’s no surprise to find music legend Sir Elton John long odds-on at 1/50 with Betfair to be at his wedding. John is best known for rewriting Candle In The Wind as a tribute to Diana when she died following a car crash in Paris back in 1997 and speculation is mounting he will perform during Harry and Meghan’s nuptials. Natalie Pinkham As the groom there’s always that tough decision of whether to invite an ex-girlfriend you still get on well with to your wedding where you’re marrying someone else or not. Sky Sports’ Formula 1 pit lane reporter Natalie Pinkham is one such former flame for Harry. Things can’t be that awkward between them, if the betting is any indicator, and she could well be there as she’s evens in the market to attend the ceremony. Sean Connery Who wouldn’t want the original James Bond at their wedding? Sean Connery is certainly Harry’s favourite actor to have portrayed the iconic British spy as he infamously told the current 007, Daniel Craig, a few years back during the premiere of Quantum Of Solace. Connery’s presence at the Royal Wedding would hardly leave us shaken (but not stirred) as he’s 3/1 in the betting to be there. Simon Cowell And finally, another familiar face from the world of entertainment. Simon Cowell is of course the driving force behind The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent. These hugely popular TV shows have elevated him to celebrity status. Cowell is 5/1 to attend the Royal Wedding – high-waisted trousers and all!'], ['Peasants Told to Celebrate Royal Wedding', '“I’s be honoured to stand along the route of the royal carriage and wave me flag for the newlyweds at the royal wedding,” Ivor Munter, 32, a peasant from Muckleworth, East London, told the BBC. According to the palace, the peasants won’t just be celebrating in the streets, but some have also been invited to attend the wedding itself, Meghan Markle and her family are so lucky. One of Us “Meghan even invited her hairdresser, butcher and road sweeper from her hometown, as well as members of her family. It’s going to be a grand affair and a right royal knees up, innit” Jack Mungo, a postman from Barking told the Sun. All over Britain, there will be street parties laid out for the starving peasants. “I ain’t eaten for a fortnight. I’ll be glad to get a bit o’ bread and soup when the wedding happens in a few weeks. Our feudal lords are so good to us,” Harry Pilchard, a peasant from the village of Shister in Yorkshire, told the BBC. Some peasants will even be given a commemorative plate with the royal couple adorning it, shame most won’t have much food to put on the plate.'], ['Socialism Needs Poor/Ethnic People, it Exploits Them and Keeps Them Down', 'Socialism is a never ending cycle of poverty Socialists all over the world are essentially farmers, they farm people who are poor, ethnic, disadvantaged. Socialism farms the poor and ethnic minorities for a number of reasons: funding, and votes. This is why socialists welcome mass migration, because essentially they are exploiting the suffering of migrants desperately seeking help — to gain voters in elections. “Once we help legal and illegal immigrants into our country, then we ply them with free benefits/housing/education/healthcare and these poor migrants will vote for us at each election guaranteed. It’s a no brainer. Look what Tony Blair did, he let in over 4.8 million migrants in less than two years and won two elections. The more migrants we let in, the more guaranteed votes we get,” a Labour spokesman revealed. Suffice to say, voting for a party other than socialist is not going to happen in any general election by a migrant who was helped in by socialists. This way, the socialists build up a vast base of voters made up of poor people, migrants, and other marginalised elements. Socialists at the top of the pyramid either in media or politics are extremely rich, and they utilise poor people as their pawns for virtue signalling political displays. It is therefore in the interests of socialists to keep poor people poor, and preferably dumb. This is why under any socialist education system the curriculums are dumbed down to a level of idiocy, or retardation. “As socialists we certainly do not want an awake public, we want people to follow us blindly and without question. This is why the Millennial generation are so pliant, they do not want freedom, in fact they rally against freedom. They have been dumbed down so much and indoctrinated by socialists, they have no thoughts of their own. For socialists, this is brilliant, because we do not want ethnics or migrants or poor people to wake up and see how we are exploiting them,” another socialist Labour party official said. Socialism is a strand of Marxism, and ultimately a cousin of communism, however, today’s students, who are so indoctrinated in socialist political ways, are too blind to see that they are ultimately moving towards full blown communism, which is the final hurdle for socialism. Those at the hierarchy of any socialist party always hide their assets, and always claim to be working for little or nothing, whilst of course dining in the best restaurants, and milking the system for as much as they can. An example of course would be the previous American president Obama, who spent over $189 million of taxpayers money on holidays for him, his entourage, his wife’s entourage and their kids. Obama milked the nation out of so much money that during his tenure the deficit rose from $9 Trillion to over $23 Trillion. Now that’s socialism at work. Spend, until other people’s money runs out…as Maggie once said. One of the biggest stooge’s of socialists of course is the racism card, and they use black and minority people as a battering ram against anything that is deemed conservative or for the nation. Socialists detest their own nation, and it is this self-hatred as well as their exploitation of minorities which brings in more votes in elections. In reality of course, the hierarchy socialists are even more racist than conservatives or equally racist, however where conservatives are more truthful in their racism, socialists would rather die than being revealed as a racist exploitative piece of shit, they would rather lie and lie to get away with any truth coming out. Socialists out of many political ideologies are indeed the most devious and nasty, and with the use of the mostly left-wing media, they are even more dangerous when out of power. We can see this with the soviet styled #metoo movement, and the underhand techniques of mass censorship of any alternative views by leftie tech monopolies. Censorship was a very efficient tool in Soviet Russia and modern communist China, and socialists use it very efficiently today cutting down free speech with a vehemence unrivalled by any other doctrine. Socialists need you to stay poor, they will give you more benefits to keep you in that vicious cycle of poverty. They need you to stay uneducated so they will dumb down school curriculums. Socialists will demand fast mass migration and once they get it, and it gets to election time, they will have voters ready to vote for them without question. Socialists exploit ethnic groups as a means to hit the right, and as much as they detest ethnics, they will put them as visibly in power, even though behind the scenes they will always be mere puppets to the same old white haired white men. Socialists when in power will do everything to keep social mobility down. One thing they never want is poor people educating themselves and moving up a notch. This would mean they might eventually vote conservative. It is therefore in the socialist’s interests to keep poor and ethnic people down by putting obstacles in their way stopping them from improving their standing. Socialism is the biggest lie that no one ever mentioned, and it is using millions of useful idiots day in day out to get the job done. Bravo to socialism. It is truly working.'], ['Russian Army Killer Robots Fuelled On Vodka', 'What better way to get killer robots to do what you want them to do — get them addicted to vodka. The AI killer robots used by the Russian army are heavy duty alcoholics who feast on copious amounts of vodka. Russian army technician, Colonel Vladimir Dimitrov, revealed how the AI killer robots have to quench their thirst. “We first get them used to the vodka. For a few months they are pumped with the good stuff, then we suddenly withdraw all vodka. The robots naturally go crazy, their addiction is so so great they will do anything for their next fix. This is when we ask them to kill everything in sight, and afterwards they get a big tanker of vodka for a reward.” Much like the Russian army regulars who are fuelled by vodka, the robots take no prisoners when they get their thirst. The robots designed by Russian army engineers are nothing more than little tanks with turrets but in squads of fifty to a hundred armed with machine gun turrets and missiles are devastating, especially if they have not had vodka for a few days. “You ever seen an angry Russian who has not had his vodka for a day or so? They get angry, itchy, with sudden outbursts, sweating like pigs. Our robots get very angry, we have to handle them with caution. Even though we have programmed them to not hurt us, the vodka desire makes their AI irrational,” Dimitrov added. NATO high command officials are said to be weary of such Russian ingenuity, and are trying to counteract the deadly vodka addicted Russian robots by introducing a type of robot that will strike fear into any enemy that dares to attack — AI robots that are addicted to coffee. Yes, the fuel for the new autonomous will be a Starbucks dream come true. AI engineer, Miles Rubio, explained how the robots are fuelled at a recent Military Symposium in Switzerland. “Americans are fuelled by coffee. We wanted something that makes Americans go crazy if they don’t get their fix, and that’s the coffee. These robots much like Americans go absolutely nuts if they don’t have gallons of coffee daily. This is how we made the robots into very efficient killers…lol.”'], ['House of Commons to Pass Act to Abolish Unelected House of Lords’ Powers', 'The devious nature of the majority of the unelected members of the House of Lords will be finally curtailed after the House of Commons passes new laws that will effectively abolish any powers the Lords currently have. The fast bi-partisan action will take place by the end of the month, as a matter of urgency, Hansard, recorded. Speaking in the Commons, one MP was livid at the backhand behaviour of the Remainer-led House of Lords who seek to derail Brexit. “There is a very good reason these unelected House of Lords peers are trying their best to stop Brexit. It is of course about their EU payments. The EU pays off 30 former MEPs and officials in the Lords with £500,000 a year in pensions. “They include seven ex-European Commissioners who swore an oath of loyalty to Brussels that means they risk losing their pension if they attack their old institutions. “It would take a combined pension pot of £10million to provide retirement income for the ex-EU peers on the same scale in the private sector. We must stop this backhander mentality where these Lords are betraying their own nation, and the democratic right of the people for wads of EU cash in brown envelopes.” Meanwhile, Lord Mandelson of Anusholl, Cumbria, was adamant that thwarting Brexit is actually a democratic process. “It does not mean a thing that I get huge payoffs from Brussels. All I care about is Italian marble on my bathroom floor, it is so shiny and fabulous to touch. My friends roll about on it all the time. I have to have the best Italian workmanship when it comes to marble flooring. Where else am I to get the money for such exquisite Italian marble floors? Yes, of course I will betray Britain for it. Ooh darling. Have you seen the shine on the floor?” Kinnock EU Gravy Train Research from Open Europe think tank reveals Baroness Kinnock earned £774,838 as an MEP. She was also entitled to a daily subsistence allowance worth £505,818 over that time, travel allowances worth almost £1.25million and general allowances worth £577,071. In addition, she was entitled to secretarial allowances worth more than £2.3million, although these are to pay staff.She also has a pension worth £67,836 a year, which would require a pot of £950,000 to buy in the private sector. Lord Kinnock earned £1.85million in salary during his 10 years at the EU and qualified for a residence allowance for living in Brussels worth £276,962, an entertainment allowance worth £64,564, an installation allowance of £25,348 for taking the job, a resettlement allowance of £13,745 for leaving the job and a transition allowance, to help adjust to life outside Brussels, worth £355,143. He also qualifies for a pension which pays out £96,857 a year and cost £1.16million to buy in the private sector. The terms require him to remain supportive of the EU project. In all, the Kinnocks qualified for pay, allowances and pensions worth £10.2million. The lack of receipts required for EU expenses makes it impossible to know if they claimed living allowances on the same home.'], ['Politics', 'An essential problem that humanity has encountered in the last 50 or so years has been that we have discovered ways to completely annihilate ourselves from the face of the planet. This is a problem because of two reasons. The first is that we are still a very long way from assuring our survival as a species. We cannot protect our cities from natural disaster including floods, earthquakes, mudslides and even Tsunamis. And even the weapons that we create to kill each other so effectively with, we have not found remedies for them. The second reason is scarier than the first. World leaders, the people who have the keys to Doomsday, seem not have matured socially. This can be easily seen by their choice of isolationist strategies. These are ideas from a dead generation that did not leave in the global village that the world has become. No longer can the success or failure of one nation or region be contained in that area. We are all affected by the decisions of people on the other side of the globe.

Out goes the blubbing oestrogen mess of Amber Rudd, another Remainer who fouled things up so badly that it has left a distinct stench of rotten eggs in the chambers. In comes a guy who one could say is a big rotten egg, who campaigned furiously during the EU Referendum against Brexit. “One of the advantages of EU membership is that we get to negotiate wider and deeper trade deals from a position of strength. If we leave, the boot will be on the other foot – and that will put Britain at a serious disadvantage.” 14 MAY 2016 Whatever Javid says today, much like May and the other Remainers in the Cabinet, must be taken with a pinch of salt. Nothing the Remainer-led cabinet has done has been good for Brexit or been true to the EU Referendum.

Brexit would be nigh on impossible, and we have sadly been proven right, time and time again. The unelected Brussels salaried House of Lords treasonous Remainers are to pass the final nail in the coffin bill for a referendum that held big promises but sadly no real fighters backing it. Britain has been proven to be a lost cowardly nation, a country of slaves who are bent over the table by the EU daily and unceremoniously fucked by large continental cocks, then brutally ordered to clean up the mess afterwards. There is no dignity left in a country where snivelling weasel traitor Remainers jostle with each other for the best position to be violently anally raped by their laughing foreign controllers who then spit on their Remainer heads as reward. The Battle of Britain was fought for nothing as was the whole of World War II. It is ironic that Britain declared victory yet have now fallen to slavery of the EU unelected masters ruling over them and dictating their laws. Millions thus died for a meaningless Pyrrhic victory.

Unfortunately, dream’s cannot be realised in already conquered countries, especially when there is so much home made treachery about. No Brexit.

What better way to reduce the population through such an innocent medium — light. Modern street lamps are triggering thousands of cancer cases, according to new research from the University of Exeter. A study found men living in large cities are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer while women are one and a half times more prone to breast cancer. Scientists blame the worrying trend on the ‘blue light’ emitted by LEDs. This reduces levels of melatonin which controls the body clock. Add into the mix the damage to human cells that radiofrequency energy does every time you use your mobile phone or are near a mast; and the Bisphenol A you ingest from all supermarket products, and the multiple types of engineered chemicals you take in from processed foods, the chemtrails, as well as the micro-carbons you breathe in from traffic fumes, naturally, the human body reacts to this — it creates changes in your body — tumours, anomalies, grotesque mutations. In short — Cancer. Who is doing this? …and why? And from this we have created an illusion, so large, so vast it will escape their perception. Those who will see it will be thought of as insane. We will create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the connection between us. We will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive. Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring suspicion upon ourselves. This will also prevent them from seeing the changes as they occur. We will always stand above the relative field of their experience for we know the secrets of the absolute. We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while pretending to do the opposite. We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle ways so they will never see what is happening. We will use soft metals, ageing accelerators and sedatives in food and water, also in the air. They will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn. The soft metals will cause them to lose their minds. We will promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will feed them more poison. The poisons will be absorbed through their skin and mouths, they will destroy their minds and reproductive systems. The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them, in what they drink, eat, breathe and wear. We must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons for they can see far. We will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images and musical tones. Those they look up to will help. We will enlist them to push our poisons. With sugar they shall be sweetened on their way to early extinction. They will see our products being used in film and will grow accustomed to them and will never know their true effect. When they give birth we will inject poisons into the blood of their children and convince them it is for their help. We will start early on, when their minds are young, we will target their children with what children love most, sweet things. When their teeth decay we will fill them with metals that will kill their mind and steal their future. When their ability to learn has been affected, we will create medicine that will make them sicker and cause other diseases for which we will create yet more medicine. We will render them docile and weak before us by our power. They will grow depressed, slow and obese, and when they come to us for help, we will give them more poison. We will focus their attention toward money and material goods so they many never connect with their inner self. We will distract them with fornication, external pleasures and games so they may never be one with the oneness of it all. Their minds will belong to us and they will do as we say. If they refuse we shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology into their lives. Virtual reality, apps, mobile phones, websites, streaming media, social networks, games, eventually leading them to be microchipped in their brains which they will accept wholeheartedly without question. We will use fear as our weapon. We will establish their governments and establish opposites within. We will own both sides. We will always hide our objective but carry out our plan. They will perform the labour for us and we shall prosper from their toil. Our families will never mix with theirs. Our blood must be pure always, for it is the way. We will make them kill each other when it suits us. We will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion. We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and how. We will guide them kindly and gently letting them think they are guiding themselves. We will foment animosity between them through our factions. When a light shall shine among them, we shall extinguish it by ridicule, or death, whichever suits us best. The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers. They will be busy killing each other. They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbours for as long as we see fit. We will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us, for they cannot see us. We will continue to prosper from their wars and their deaths. We shall repeat this over and over until our ultimate goal is accomplished. We will continue to make them live in fear and anger though images and sounds. We will use all the tools we have to accomplish this. The tools will be provided by their labour. We will make them hate themselves and their neighbours. We will always hide the divine truth from them, that we are all one. This they must never know! They must never know that colour is an illusion, they must always think they are not equal. Drop by drop, drop by drop we will advance our goal. We will take over their land, resources and wealth to exercise total control over them. We will deceive them into accepting laws that will steal the little freedom they will have. We will establish a money system that will imprison them forever, keeping them and their children in debt. When they shall band together, we shall accuse them of crimes and present a different story to the world for we shall own all the media. We will use our media to control the flow of information and their sentiment in our favour. When they shall rise up against us we will crush them like insects, for they are less than that. They will be helpless to do anything for they will have no weapons. The truth will be hidden in their face, so close they will not be able to focus on it until its too late. Oh yes, so grand the illusion of freedom will be, that they will never know they are our slaves. When all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them. This reality will be their prison. They will live in self-delusion. When our goal is accomplished a new era of domination will begin. Their minds will be bound by their beliefs, the beliefs we have established from time immemorial.'], ['Bubba Waiting For Bill Cosby in His Cell', 'Good news rarely comes in these days, but when it does, sneeze into your napkin and thank the stars above for finally delivering justice upon Bill Cosby. Bill Cosby will be going to jail hopefully for a long time after being convicted of rape. The jury in Bill Cosby’s retrial found the TV icon guilty of all three counts of aggravated indecent assault on Thursday for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his home in a Philadelphia suburb in 2004. The 80-year-old comedian faces up to 10 years in prison on each count, but is likely to serve them concurrently. It has been a long time coming, but America’s Daddy is a rapist and deserves everything he gets. Already, the jail where Cosby will go is getting ready for their celebrity rapist guest. San Quentin State Prison, located north of San Francisco is preparing the cell for Bill and is looking forward to his arrival. “We got a special cell mate for Cosby. His name is Bubba. He is 7’2 weighing 380 lbs. He likes old guys and we in the prison service just look the other way when he wants to get his way. Bubba is already stocking up on lube which he gets from the machine shop where he works,” the prison’s warden, Chuck Mallory told the San Fran Times. It has been many years in the making, but Mr Cosby has been a slippery customer, justice has a way of rearing its greasy head in between those butt cheeks once in awhile, even with rigged justice systems geared to the advantage of celebrities in the U.S. Enjoy your stay Dr. Huxtable..'], ['Jacob Rees-Mogg Becomes Tory PM After Lacklustre May Ousted', 'Former prime minister, Theresa May was today licking her wounds after a devastating coup by Tory Brexiteers who ousted her late last night from her job. The spectacular coup was completed in 15 minutes according to those present, and May had no discourse but to resign in shame after the way she had handled the Brexit. “May who has conceded too much to the EU was as useful as a drum kit in Anne Frank’s attic. She is obviously a Remainer, therefore she does not have a mandate to safeguard this nation from those who seek to do it harm. We had to remove her to gain back our sovereignty,” one backbencher revealed. Indeed, Theresa May capitulated much to the EU demands, and if it was not for the coup, Britain would have been stuck in the Customs Union and Single Market. This effectively would mean there would not be a Brexit, and Britain would not have been able to make its own trade deals, as well as control its own borders. “It is safe to say that May listened to Remainers more than Brexiteers. The House of Lords’ unelected peers who defeated the government on a recent Brexit bill were on large payrolls from Brussels, so naturally they were paid off corrupted individuals who willingly sold their own country off for backhanders from the EU. However, the former PM, was not paid off by Brussels to our knowledge, but betrayed her own country through sheer unwillingness to stand up to Brussels and their ludicrous demands,” another backbencher revealed. The new PM, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has struck fear into the heart of the EU, and is even planning on curtailing the crooked Remainer unelected peers in the House of Lords, many of which are receiving backhanders from Brussels. This spectacular turn of events can only be good for Britain, which needs someone as strong as Thatcher to pull through the slings and arrows of outrageous EU demands.'], ['Congratulations to Baby Machine Kate Middleton', 'One can’t fault the selfless nature of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, who has popped out another sprog, one of many, and there are more to come. The third baby in a few years is an incredible job for Kate who has achieved real momentum in the Windsor family. Royal correspondent, Cressida Montague commented on the wonderful news following the third birth. “I think it stems from Kate’s background, her ancestral coal mining family. In those days families had to have ten or twenty children because the mortality rate for infants was so high. We’re talking about the 19th century coming on to the early 20th century. It’s just in her blood. She has to pop one out every few years as a form of inbuilt centuries old instinct.” In 1821, Middleton’s great-great-great-great grandfather James Harrison was a miner in the north east. It was far removed from palace life in London, where Prince William’s great-great-great-great-great uncle, King George IV, was living a life of opulent luxury and debauchery as an overly indulgent monarch. When George IV died and his younger brother ascended the throne, Harrison’s male children, as young as 11, were being lowered into the coal pits. Plans for new wing When most royals have one or two at the most, the Cambridges want to go for five or seven. There are plans to even build a whole new wing to Kensington palace to house the lot of them. Sir Reginald Mathers, an advisor to the royal couple has announced the building of a totally new wing for Kensington palace to start in 2020. “We’re expecting three or four more babies so now is the time to start building a garish new wing for the children to be housed. The cost to the taxpayer will not be announced, or the upkeep costs.” Meanwhile, the duchess, who has never worked an honest day’s work in her life, is happily content in her role as a royal baby pumper, pumping out the blighters two a dozen every few years. Here’s to a royal income boost, the other side of the coin perhaps, for each little critter an x amount income boost, much like benefits — but the royal kind.'], ['Theresa May Sudden Rigor Mortis Explained By Government Scientists', 'British PM Theresa May, who suddenly started displaying the effects of rigor mortis on Monday is currently being examined in a covert governmental facility somewhere in Salisbury. Number 10 aides were alerted to the PM’s condition this morning at breakfast time when she was making some toast and talking about her lacklustre performance for Brexit as well as how she plans to concede all terms to the EU. “She was making the toast, then I noticed cracking sounds coming from her face. Her body stiffened and then as if struck by Medusa’s gaze she froze like a statue. We carried her out to the hallway and she just stood there with an open dead gaze. After calling the medic he surmised that the PM was having a bout of rigor mortis, although he could record a faint pulse,” Number 10 aide, Ashley Sommer, told the Daily Telegraph. Rigor mortis The prime minister may have been accidentally zapped by a governmental program that is used to control the population. Utilising microwave energy within the biolelectric wave spectrum, the electromagnetic waves are broadcast from mobile phone masts, wifi and from mobile delivery systems. “The CIA in the US developed the system in the 1990s as a way to control humans en masse as well as individuals who they wish to either eliminate or put under their control. “By the use of the bioelectric spectrum, mostly at 10 Hz, when inducing a form of rigor mortis over the victim, the program can render humans inactive and unable to function in daily life. They can also transmit images into the minds of individuals. For example, say a target is already mentally unstable, if the active control centre transmits images inducing the individual to carry out a mass shooting, then it can be very effective. This technique is especially useful in areas of black ops, to engender a population crisis regarding gun control or any other usage of the Hegellian Dialectic,” chief engineer at Los Alamos weapons research facility revealed last year. Questions are however being asked about how on earth the PM was accidentally zapped by the covert control system. A parliamentary body will discuss the findings today, however, the program is top secret and will have to be handled behind closed doors. Meanwhile, an emergency meeting of Cobra was announced by the deputy prime minister. “Unfortunately, we cannot discuss the circumstances under which the PM has been struck down. These programs are heavily classified and officially do not exist,” a Number 10 spokesman revealed today.'], ['#MeToo Creator Sets Off to Study African Wildlife to Better Understand Natural Male Behaviour', 'Arriving in the lush green hills of Uganda in deepest Africa, Tarana Burke, the #metoo founder funded by George Soros has come on a fact finding anthropological/biological study on the relationships wild animals have with each other. “I want to find out what the biological instinct of the male is in wild animals. I am eager to first study the mountain gorillas in the forests of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and Volcanoes National Park,” #metoo creator, Burke told the National Geographic. Deep in the jungle, the expensive trip is set to cost over $32 million, and is of course further funded by the Soros Open Society fund, as well as other agencies that fund the #metoo movement. Gorillas in the mist “The male gorilla is usually dominant in the troop. Dominant male gorillas are called silverbacks and are more aggressive than other group members since the troop’s safety is their responsibility. The silverback makes all group decisions, is responsible for most of the group calls, receives the dominant portion of food (even when resources are limited) and can terminate troublesome behaviour with just a vicious look. A male must have an established home range and great strength to confront any rival before acquiring his own troop. Therefore most silverbacks are usually solitary for about 4 years and turn 15 before acquiring a troop of their own,” Burke revealed in her study. Unfortunately, the plight of the gorillas is in constant flux due to the threat of poachers, however thanks to great care in the sanctuaries of the national parks they are relatively safe. Pride of the lion “I also studied the male lion in their prides to better understand the natural biological makeup of things. It seems the male lions rarely survive to adulthood. This is why there are many more females in each pride. It is very hard to survive to adulthood if you are a male. “When male lions begin to reach sexual maturity around age two, the older males within the pride kick them out. The female lions, which are usually all related to some degree, typically stay behind. “Life is very hard for the male lions. For a young male, the betrayal by his own blood must be confusing to him, but this is an ancient rite — the casting out of young males into a world of unknowns — a world where he will be able make it, or die. “After being kicked out, the young males roam the countryside solo or in small bands, often with their brothers or cousins, negotiating the no-cat’s-land between territories of other lions. If they stray into these territories, they are likely to be attacked or killed. A majority of male lions die during this time. “Lions are also prized by human hunters and poachers so that is an additional factor to the survival of the male lions. “If they survive long enough to find a promising new area, the next step is to take over another pride. But of course resident males will have none of that, and so they end up fighting, often to the death. “When male lions take over a new territory, they almost always kill the prides’ cubs, since they are not biologically related and do not want to spend energy ensuring that other lions’ genes will be passed on. Lions cannot be stepfathers, also female lions will not be receptive to mating while they are nursing, so killing the cubs enables the male lions to procreate.” Burke’s study of natural wildlife animal behaviours and instincts has somewhat changed her view of the anti-male #metoo fiasco which she heads. “I realised that there is a biological reason for most behaviour. Although humans are top of the animal chain and generally not tied to brute instinct, we still have these urges, which we control for most of the time. It is natural for the male of the species to generally be on top of the female in most cases. The female is submissive in most animal groups and this should include the female human. We are not equal, we are human, they are animals, but male and female are not equal and will never be. This is the biological way and the male of the species is always going to have different characteristics than the female. We must accept these differences as it is ingrained in biology.”'], ['House of Lords: Rats in the Sewer', 'Pest controllers have been called out to the House of Lords after an outbreak of filthy fucking rats turned the former respectable establishment into a sewer. Led by chief filthy sewer rat, Lord Adonis, the rats ran amuck across the House of Lords spreading treachery and other un-democratic anti-voter sentiment. “These treacherous rats must be cleaned out. They are stinking out the whole establishment with their authoritarian socialist pseudo-Marxist sewage, and selling out their own country to our enemies,” one of the only upstanding Lords left, Lord Lamont remarked. The filthy rats that are creating such an outright mess escaped from a sewer pipe on Monday, and have been running across all the seats in the House demanding £300 each to sit down. “The filthy fucking rat, Lord Adonis, who looks nothing like Adonis, is a real nuisance.

His family have frantically tried to assure him that there is nothing to be offended by, however to no avail the Millennial has been seriously affected. “He drinks his soy milk every day, which increases his oestrogen levels enough to develop large bitch tits. He is a fervent supporter of a Victorian snowflake puritan lifestyle with no mention of sex or other vices that may trigger his sensitive constitution. Somehow though, he has triggered his own trigger and has offended his own snowflake sensibilities,” Melchoe’s concerned auntie told the LA Times. Microagggressions Psychologist, Brandt Mayer, has tried to coax Melchoe from his Safe Space however the many attempts have failed miserably. “The episode began under my understanding when Jordan was on YouTube and accidentally came across a heavy metal video from the 1980s. He was immediately triggered because he saw these men playing music that he had never heard before. The feeling of pure testosterone, and images of beautiful women throwing their undergarments at the men may have triggered an inert subconscious desire in him. Here he was, a miserable politically correct soy drinking loser whose genitals had shrunk, his moobs flopping all over the place listening to emasculating chart music dominated by women, here he was, an activist for feminism, anti-guns, anti-sex, anti-fun and other causes that seek to destroy the traditional family and biological natural way — he must have realised what a pathetic fucking loser he is, how he has been manipulated from the beginning by the indoctrinating politically correct school system of socialist agenda creators, and how he had passed so far from the path of masculinity.”'], ['World War 3 Will Start Suddenly and Without Warning', 'Ordo ab Chao There will be little television coverage of the start of World War 3 because many will not know it has started, including the media. What seems important now and is covered in hysterical news headlines about World War 3 is nothing, it is simply sensationalist fairy dust as usual by the mainstream media who are only concerned about clickbait for their advertiser revenue. When World War 3 actually starts, there will be minimal coverage by the media and the events leading up to initial incursions will be seen as not interesting enough to even report. The thing about major wars is they usually start suddenly and without warning, and the third world war will be mainly conventional. The correct trigger To qualify for a world war, there has to be mobilisation from all corners of the earth. Therefore, if we have confrontations only in one part, it is not generally flagged as World War, however a fire has to start somewhere, and this usually spreads quite quickly if there is the correct territorial kindling. Furthermore, world war would inevitably have to include the world’s large powers, for it to be correctly labelled as a world war. Therefore, we would have to see the USA, Russia, China, Japan, as well as European and Australasian countries skirmish. China in a third world war scenario would immediately go for Australia and New Zealand. This would be their first move, after taking Taiwan in less than a few hours. Russia would invariably increase its territory by taking former Soviet states, as well as pushing into Sweden, Finland and Norway as well as incursions into Middle Eastern territory. Norway and Middle Eastern territories have large oil and gas reserves and would be a great prize for Russia. Norway, as well as being on the cusp of the sea, is only a small jaunt to Britain. Whether Russia would utilise nuclear weapons on the UK in an initial push is to be debated, however there is credence in thought that the Russians see the UK as a vast threat to their plans and do not see any usable resources in Britain. Most probably there would be over thirty nuclear bombs dropped on Britain to silence it once and for all, if it refuses to surrender to Russian might bearing down on it. It is safe to say that in the initial moments of Russian movement into Europe, the French would surrender almost immediately. This would be done to safeguard Paris and its architecture as in WW2. Germany would put up a fight, alongside NATO, but movement would be too slow, as the Russians have everything planned already, their main ally is speed and efficiency without slow democratic political processes slowing them down. Coupled with the threat of World War 3, there is also the race to develop robotic military functional applications, the advancement of nanotechnology used in warfare, as well as the development of Artificial Intelligent systems, by Chinese, American and Russian scientists, as well as modified chemical materials utilised in warfare. The key to all of this is, would the US utilise their nuclear arsenal if the Russians made a move into Europe? Well, to answer this, one only has to look at Hitler’s incursion into Europe before and during WW2. The Americans not only financed Hitler, but stood about watching Hitler and his army butcher their way through Poland, France and the rest of Europe. It was not until the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour that made the Americans do something, otherwise they would have done absolutely nothing. Britain would have been lost to the German forces eventually, just through sheer numbers, and dwindling supplies hit by U-boats. It is safe to say that the US would therefore be cautious in its initial actions during a Russian and Chinese incursion. One must also not forget the other rogues, or variables in the mix. Iran and North Korea, who would most probably put to their advantage any weakness seen by the Western Allies. Iran, will attack Israel from all sides, and they will be joined by other Islamic states. This action alone will not mean the end of Israel, as the militarised state will hit back with all its might crushing the attackers ruthlessly. They will then push on further into Arab territory, gaining Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iran. The other big dogs of war who are itching for a fight are India and Pakistan, two nuclear capable countries. Who is to say they do not face off, maybe drop a nuke on Delhi and one on Islamabad? The aftermath of course would be cleaned up by China, as their millions of troops surge into the region on the premise of ‘Keeping the Peace’. Back in the United Nations, there will be talk, but no solution, because there can be no solution to what is irresistible for many nations, holding back for so long. The delegates will know what they are dealing with, but it will be too late, and after the talking is over, there will be even more talking — a useless conversation to a very old question. World War 3 will not necessarily be nuclear. How about cyber warfare where millions of Russian and Chinese hackers take down electricity grids/crucial utilities, or maybe an EMP burst in the upper atmosphere frying all electronic components, or what about satellites being blown up leaving many agencies and the military blind? There are effective alternatives to full nuclear war. No state in the world wants to use their nuclear arsenal because this means the territory they may conquer by conventional military warfare would be irradiated and useless. No one wants a nuclear winter covering the sun for ten years, where all vegetation and animals die off. It is not in their interests for mutual self destruction, however many bunkers they have. Therefore, it is safe to say that World War 3 will mainly be conventional warfare, however, if it comes to an end scenario where one nuclear power is in serious danger of being wiped out conventionally, then, someone like Vladimir Putin will press the red button. His stance is that if Russia ceases to exist, so should the others cease to exist. “But as a citizen of Russia, as a head of the Russian state, I want to ask – why do we need a world if Russia ceases to exist?” The precursor for war is much like a rubber band. How far can one pull back a rubber band before it snaps back into place? The natural circle and cycle of history for Mankind has always been a state of war, and since the last major war in the late 1930s to 40s, the rubber band has been stretching and stretching. Soon, the laws of physics state that the rubber band will snap back into place, much like the tectonic plates suddenly snapping back after a major earthquake. Dwindling finite resources on earth, and increasing populations mean that the final push for one singular faction to control all — is inevitable.'], ['Assad: “I Can Still Make Barrel Bombs From Chlorine – a Very Common Chemical”', 'President Assad, otherwise known as the Butcher of Syria, who has no qualms in gassing his own people, was defiant after the pretty much useless bombing of some factories that were not in use, by the Allied forces of Britain, France and the United States. “Chlorine is a very common chemical that anyone can get or make in large quantities. When we make barrel bombs to drop on civilians from our helicopters that is all we use. Therefore, what have the Allies done? Nothing much really, apart from bomb a few factories which we can rebuild anywhere else.” The defiant stance by Assad is in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who has already declared victory with the seminal words seen once before “Mission Accomplished” uttered by the now retired failure, George W Bush. Apart from riling the already angry Russians, this bombing fiasco is not so much an answer to the recent gassing by whoever did it, but more of a cursory reconnaissance mission in Russian capabilities of revenge. “Ideally, the Russians will react to the bombing. This is what the Americans and allies want to see. They want to see what sort of vengeful reaction the Russians will have. This bombing was ultimately not about Assad and his use of chemical weapons on civilians, but on how Vladimir Putin reacts. Most probably, the Russians will not take direct action but will take their vengeance the quiet silent way, i.e. a major hacking cyber attack, or maybe they will do other clandestine operations to destabilise the West. You see, the Russians prefer stealth to direct obtuse action. Overt reactions are too obvious,” a former agency analyst revealed on Monday. The only way to win the war in Syria is for the Allies to invade fully with boots on the ground. Naturally, this will never happen, simply because of Russian bases present in the country.'], ['Are Google and YouTube Staff Now More Despised Than Traffic Wardens?', 'A recent Nori poll questioned internet users on the censorious biased methods of Google and Youtube staffers, revealing their pariah status excelling even that of traffic wardens. “We found that a whopping 94% of internet users now detest Google and YouTube so much that they actually prefer traffic wardens. Being a traffic warden is one of the worst jobs anyone can do in life, simply because the amount of negativity and hatred that comes your way every day, well, Google and YouTube is now ahead of that and are even more hated than those pesky traffic wardens handing out tickets,” poll manager, Allen Klein revealed. Not Evil One participant revealed that he used to like Google “before it turned evil” but now even the mere mention of the company makes his skin crawl. “Google used to be seen as this friendly company back in the day, but once they got global domination and monopoly, their true colours shone through. Now if I even see the logo I start sweating and have to look away. It’s gotten so bad that I’m using the internet less now. I used to run some websites but Google censored so much that nothing is left now and their monopoly over the world wide web is so pervasive that it’s nothing but a complete takeover.” The recent shooting spree at the Californian YouTube offices because of the policy of unjustified censorship was another indication that the tide has firmly turned from favourable to extreme hatred. “When you take away someone’s livelihood, it sometimes means that the person cracks. One only has to study the 1993 film starring Michael Douglas – Falling Down, to see how things can end up. This is what YouTube staff are doing day in day out, they’re censoring people’s rights to free speech, their right to freedom of expression and ultimately their right to make revenue off of their videos or websites. It is not only the totalitarian censorship that is disgusting but also the biased manner in which they do it,” another ex-YouTube user revealed. One other former YouTube Google user revealed: “After the way Google treated me and pretty much everyone I know; the other day when I got a ticket from a traffic warden, I frankly could not give a damn. It was nothing compared to the way biased Google mistreats its users.”'], ['Syria: The Geopolitical Red Line the West Will Never Cross', 'Back in August 2013, the Daily Squib wrote an article warning of the West’s encroachment into Russian controlled Syria. What pundits on mainstream media are writing about today, we already figured out in 2013, and we firmly stand by our analysis of the situation now as much as then. The West must be weary of the bear backed into a corner, as crossing the red line of Syria is a one way street with no return. Today, we have Donald Trump as president of the United States, who has so far acted cautiously regarding any intrusion into Syria, even after the recent gassing by whoever did it. This is the question we must always ask, who did the deed? In a world where governments happily hurt and murder their own citizens for their own political and geopolitical gains, nothing can be counted out. There is now no trust in any global government as their nefarious techniques have too often been revealed. The news coming from Syria cannot be trusted as the mainstream media is heavily tied to governmental rules and military intelligence propaganda. Unless there are news agencies working independently on the ground free of reporting restrictions, we will never know what is really happening. Amongst the posturing, strutting apes paraded around the news desks barking for war, none of it should be believed. This is why the Daily Squib is so calm about the situation currently at hand, we simply do not believe anything will happen because the West is too fucking shit scared of Russia and the evil mastermind, Putin. If the alleged Assad gassing of civilians continues, nothing will be done again. We will of course get more baloney posturing but that’s it. The game is already won by Putin, his stranglehold of the region is complete, and Syria is the territorial global red line that cannot be crossed unless a fully fledged war ensues. There is nothing to see. Stop screaming in abject terror. This is nothing. Please go back to your boring banal life of nothingness.

From the birth of the World Wide Web, these power nerds have created and grown companies that are now monopolies controlling every facet of people’s lives. Smartphones, apps, search engines, social networks – power nerds are in everything, their power increases daily as more millions of people use their networks. Power nerds are ruthless, they are creatures who do not balk in crushing their opponents completely without mercy and their greed for complete controlling power over everything is boundless. To quote a few examples of companies that are run by ruthless power nerds, we can of course cite Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and Google. These companies are not only seeking to rule and control everything, they also are using their power to manipulate data taken from their platforms to make money and increase their influence, as well as shut down any voices that are not left leaning. All Hail Zuckerberg “Power nerds are inherently evil. Zuckerberg is one example of a power nerd so power hungry that he pursues global domination with a vehement ruthless nasty streak. These tech robots are machines, they are not really human anymore, their fuel is pure power and more power, and they will use billions of people to achieve their goals at all cost. Tech power nerds are farmers of people, they farm billions of people for data,” an observer of the current situation revealed. Power nerds also do not have a problem about farming data from billions of people without their knowledge, they also abuse their positions to be politically biased and censor free speech as a means of gaining even more power. One can only hope that companies like Facebook one day are brought to justice for their evil, devious crimes committed against billions of people. In 2009, Facebook was caught lying to their account holders about the amount and type of information it was collecting on them, and the company also explicitly lied about who they were providing that information to. As a result, the Federal Trade Commission censured the company in 2011 for violations of Article 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The core mission of Article 5 of the FTC Act is to protect consumer welfare and prevent unfair business acts or practices from occurring. In defiance of the Federal Trade Commission’s order, Facebook continued to reveal their customers private account information to unauthorized individuals and corporations and is therefore liable for civil penalties of $41,484 per each violation – a fine that could reach $3 trillion Dollars. Talking about fines, Google, a company that controls 91.5% of search traffic in Europe alone, is being slapped with antitrust fines from the EU, but it’s only for a measly £2.14 billion, which for a company that pays literally no tax, is peanuts. At the end of the day, these companies led by power nerds have now spread their octopus-like grip over the whole globe, and to even begin deconstructing their evil plan of complete control, will be nearly impossible now unless these companies are fined, broken up and told to pay the tax they owe. Hopefully one day the power nerds are put in their place, and we can all breathe a breath of fresh air on a free internet once again.'], ['Dreaming About the Best Online Casino Portal On the Internet', 'There’s something about the feel of a real casino, the smell, the sounds of dealers dealing, the chinking of cash falling from slot machines.

Usually the Windsors sup on boring old fodder. The Queen for example will break out the gin and Dubonnet before chowing down on grilled Dover sole with some sauteed veg on the side, you know maybe some spinach or a courgette. Certainly nothing starchy. Prince Charles, a boiled egg aficionado has them served by a team of twenty servants who wait for approval of each egg presented to the prince.

One day after the horrendous shooting by a crazed videologger, YouTube staff were bused in to their California campus. The convoy of heavily armoured vehicles began the journey 40 miles away and made its way slowly to the YouTube offices. Police escorts and SWAT teams were on standby, and people even lined the streets to see the spectacle. “Look up there. There’s a helicopter, AWACS and a few drones,” Jon Trench, 34, a local butcher said pointing up. Many of the staff bused in under armoured cover are known YouTube censors so this is why Google is not taking any chances. Security was so tight in the HQ today that if you even dropped a pin on the floor, fifty armed guards were on standby to surround you with automatic weapons pointed at your head. “We’re not taking any chances anymore. I guess what goes around comes around. Censor enough people and one of them’s going to be a psychotic nut with a vendetta,” one YouTube employee said from under his balaclava.

The spate of vicious murders in the capital city, are a serious cause for concern for anti-gun campaigners. “We need to ban guns in London especially because they’re using Ak47 assault rifles, automatic pistols and all sorts of guns to murder people,” Moron said from the safety of his Cotswolds mansion cottage. Anti-gun campaigners are now petitioning the government to ban guns in the UK, because gun control really works. Ban them now. I am sure if you ban guns all the gun murders will stop “We need to say to these people. Put down your guns. There is no need to shoot someone. All these people really need is to sit down and have a nice cup of tea and a happy conversation with someone. Guns are not the answer. Ban them now.

Under ‘Red’ Ken Livingstone, the stabbings were so prolific that Londoners would only venture out into the streets under armed guard protection, today, it’s a lot better, you only need a stab proof vest. Statistics show that Tuesday last week saw a slight drop and only 40,000 fatalities from murder occured. Londoner, Ed Corn, 45, says he only got stabbed three times on one day, and was appreciative of the gesture. “I only got stabbed three times. One in the left buttock, one just above my liver, and the other a mere slash of the throat. Just missed the jug. It has been like a holiday for me. I actually feel relieved.” Labour’s London is a dirty cesspit of violence and hatred Arthur Grenfell, said that living in the capital he was all too appreciative of the current situation: “Living in London these days, an overcrowded cesspit of shit where every road space is filled with useless bus lanes, bike lanes and lanes for mobility scooters. The buses come in sevens and are always empty, churning out vile fumes into every pore of your body and up your filthy nostrils. The rude Eastern Europeans all with their unregistered vehicles hog the roads and pavements fearless of ever getting a ticket. There are no road rules any more, there is no highway code, that went many years ago. The air smells like a festering tramp’s fresh diarrhoea explosion in your local library. London today is an expensive toilet where people pay through the nose to live in tiny squalid houses if you can call them that, they pay through the nose to work in the capital, and invariably, they pay to die in it too.” Life in the capital today under Labour is such hell that getting stabbed or shot by a Yardie wannabe is actually a relief. “I was shot four times on Thursday buying some jam from the local Sklep. It was a relief actually because eventually when the ambulance came six hours later, they took me to a hospital 250 miles away from London. They said there were no beds in the hospitals across the capital, apparently its a new EU initiative where they bring in millions of people from the poorest countries in the world to use up our resources.

Today, they protest to have their freedoms taken away. To protest against the right to defend oneself or one’s family is the sort of deranged state the youth are in today. These indoctrinated lemmings seem to be reading from someone’s script, and they do not really know what they are saying or what freedom fundamentally means. Propaganda crisis-porn Actors in the current chess game, pawns like Hogg, a jumped up little turd who is so autocued you might as well see the strings controlling him as the puppeteers sneer insanely behind the scenes.

They cannot have a thought for themselves, they do not know how to function without someone telling them how to think. Their indoctrination is so ingrained, that it is scientifically impossible to undo the damage. They have grown up with no privacy, or freedom, so who can blame them when they march to take away the hard fought freedoms that soldiers in both world wars died to protect.” The sickening sound of brainwashed chants coming from the very well organised and funded rallies, does not look like a real spontaneous rally where people do something out of genuine emotion, instead it looks like carefully choreographed crisis-porn.

Analysing the current socialist media push in America to repeal the Second Amendment is a sad affair. Here we have the networks on 24 hour shifts pushing out anti-gun propaganda on a constant loop, that is frankly tiresome and old. Then we have the university students, indoctrinated by their Marxist professors, and to top it all off, there’s the tech companies and social media effect where paid Soros shills as well as Chinese globalist operatives constantly bleed out the anti-second amendment narrative. How do you destabilise a country from within? Divide it of course, and this is what China along with Russia are trying to do. Consider the fact, would you want a fully armed up population against you in any invasion? In Switzerland, it is mandatory that every citizen is armed, and this provides a good incentive to not invade. The collective moaning and sulking is not only tiresome to watch, but pitiful. It is however a technique used time and time again to change the views of the masses who are targeted. Amongst the useless marches and lie-ins, nothing is achieved. No gun legislation will ever be achieved by peaceful means in the U.S, so these misguided idiots are rallying just for the sake of rallying. Why not make it a day out in Washington D.C, see the sights, buy that smelly hotdog, then jump on the bandwagon for a few hours listening to communist speakers rally the useless troops? After the Obama Marxist reign, American socialists are even more of a joke, and to see them so triggered is proof that the majority are very easily controlled by their controllers. Most of the protesters who shout for the ban of the AR-15 do not even know that it is a semi-automatic (i.e. it can only make one shot at a time). Fully automatic AR-15s are now banned, but this passes by the deranged ill informed protesters who hold their placards up simply to feel like they are part of a crowd. If they knew they were marching for China, maybe they would think again, however many would probably appreciate the communist sentiment. Similar to sheep and lemmings, the socialists calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment right to bear arms, are following a mantra they simply do not understand, and they are completely clueless as to who is pulling the strings behind the scenes. Banning does nothing First of all, banning guns does nothing, because then you have illegal weapons, and the trade for those will increase exponentially. Much like the drug trade, if one bans something, it gains value. Traffickers are begging for gun control, because that means they will have sole distribution rights. One only has to look at Prohibition in the 1920s. The Mafia made billions in today’s money after alcohol was banned in the United States for a period of time. Secondly, why stop at guns? Cars kill, knives kill and if you do it right so can a ballpoint pen. Do you want these things banned too? Thirdly, trying to take away a real Americans’ gun is akin to taking away their right to defend themselves or their families. This right is so ingrained in American society and culture that it will take a civil war to achieve. Naturally, the first people who will be shot in an another American civil war will be the dweebs who don’t like guns and protested against them. What do you think will happen when every gun toting American suddenly wakes up to what is happening? It’s gonna be trigger time. A lot of Americans are positively itching for the gun grab to happen, because they know where the unarmed anti-gun people live. Civil war would be like hunting season all over again, except this time substitute the jack rabbit for the Hogg stooge and his brainwashed commie compatriots. Looting, fucking, shooting, and cold blooded murder, the whole shithouse will go up in flames overnight. Like lighting a match under a firework factory, astronauts will be able to watch the whole shooting spree from the space station all the way up there in orbit. As for the U.K, banning guns was no big deal simply because it never had a gun culture ingrained as much as Americans. The docile British are so well controlled that they happily pay as much tax as possible without even complaining. In America, that just would not stand, and the people would make things happen one way or another. The exact is opposite in the U.K. where every indignity and non-freedom is accepted willingly by the populace without so much as a whimper. America was built by the gun. Maybe, it will die by the gun.'], ['Agent Cob: “Jews in Gulags That’s How I’d Do It”', 'Former Soviet-era spy, Agent Cob, aka Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour party, has revealed his vehement anti-semitism to his followers. Speaking from his dacha in New Malden, the ex-spy revealed his final solution for the Jews. “Stalin, is a great hero of mine. He put millions of Jews into the gulags in Siberia where they perished from hard work and certain starvation. When I am leader, I will solve the Jew problem by putting them all in gulags in Northern Britain, which some say is a worse fate than being in Siberia.” The Great Purge Now that Labour is aligned with anti-semitic policies, when it gets into power, it will purge Britain of Jews as it views them as zionist infiltrators to the Soviet British cause. Momentum, a radical arm of the Labour party will spearhead the purge initiative, by disseminating anti-Jewish propaganda. The Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn will thus rid Britain of Jews, such is their vitriol and hatred towards them. Much like Stalin, who murdered millions of Jews, so too will Corbyn follow in his steps. After the foundation of Israel in May 1948, and its alignment with the USA in the Cold War, the 2 million Soviet Jews, who had always remained loyal to the Soviet system, were portrayed by the Stalinist regime as a potential fifth column and labelled Enemy of the People. Despite his personal dislike of Jews, Stalin had been an early supporter of a Jewish state in Palestine, which he had hoped to turn into a Soviet satellite in the Middle East. But as the leadership of the emerging state proved hostile to approaches from the Soviet Union, Stalin became increasingly afraid of pro-Israeli feeling among Soviet Jews. His fears intensified as a result of Golda Meir’s arrival in Moscow in the autumn of 1948 as the first Israeli ambassador to the USSR. On her visit to a Moscow synagogue on Yom Kippur, thousands of people lined the streets, many of them shouting Am Yisroel chai (‘The people of Israel live!’)—a traditional affirmation of national renewal to Jews throughout the world but to Stalin a dangerous sign of ‘bourgeois Jewish nationalism’ that subverted the authority of the Soviet state. Stalin’s response was to remove many prominent Jews from public office, albeit quietly, and send thousands to gulags where they simply disappeared. The irony is that it was the Jewish Bolsheviks who had played a very important role in the Soviet cultural revolution in the first place, however under Stalin, they were now deemed the Enemy of the People. He also made sure that any cultural references to Jewish people or the state of Israel would be shut down, including museums and cultural centres. Much like Stalin, Corbyn detests anything that is linked with Western democracy, and it is unfortunate for the Jews that they are a scapegoat now as much as in Stalin’s day.'], ['French Waiter Fired For Being Too French', 'Sometimes satire melts into real life news, and these days this phenomenon is all too common, especially when it comes to the French sensibility. Here we have a news story of a Canadian restaurant firing a perfectly good French waiter simply because he was way too French for their liking. In alleging discrimination Rey said French culture just “tends to be more direct and expressive.” He owes his sacking to his “direct, honest and professional personality,” which he acquired while training in France’s hospitality industry. North Americans and Canadians (even French Canadians) simply do not understand what French manners are like. In Paris, if a waiter spits in your soup just as he is to serve it to you, that is considered a considerable compliment. He will do this while eyeing up your girlfriend or wife, and giving her his phone number. In France, not an eyelid is batted by the locals to such behaviour. For Parisian waiters, to be rude, offhand, aggressive and downright arrogant is just a way of life, it is a form of expressionistic painting, the joie de vivre without life’s enjoyment but sheer purpose in serving the customer their overpriced haute cuisine slop. “For tourists, we put on a show for them. Especially the Japanese ones who have this idealistic view of France, you know cobbled streets, a beret carrying a baguette under the arm. We insult these cochons then charge them through the roof, and they love it, when they leave traumatised for life,” a particularly arrogant Parisian waiter recently revealed.

If you are holding your prize Deagle primed with some .50 AE ammo and you can’t control the recoil, you might as well be pissing in the wind, this is why you need gun control. You empty a clip, your reload time may be a life or death situation, this is why you need to reload fast, and have many magazines available for the next burst of fire, this is all about gun control. Collateral damage, this is acceptable in the military but on the streets or home can get you locked up for good, therefore when you’re aiming, get the right target (the bad guy) for fuck’s sake. Gun control is a very important aspect of this situation otherwise you could end up with multiple instances of collateral damage. What about jamming? If your weapon of choice is not properly maintained, cleaned and oiled, then you will get more instances of your firearm jamming due to fouling. You don’t want that to happen if you’re in a serious life threatening situation and firing a fully automatic or semi auto weapon. Revolvers are generally more reliable, but they still need to be maintained and under gun control. Gun control is also about what gauge you use with your weapon. What can you handle well? Know your limits. It’s a toss up between blowing major holes in somebody or something or getting that accurate clean head shot into the cranium with little or no recoil. Practice, practice, practice! If you don’t practice with your gun, you won’t know how to control the gun. This is why access to a good shooting range is invaluable. Don’t forget, gun control is not only about controlling the gun but most of all controlling yourself. If someone cuts in line at the fast food restaurant, just let it go, sure you can say a few words, maybe have a fist fight, but no guns will be needed there. Gun control is mostly about responsibility. You should only ever use your weapon when in serious fear of your life, and mostly on your own property to protect your family and yourself. Hopefully with these tips, you will adhere to good gun control and live a long happy life of liberty including the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms. Remember, the founding fathers wrote the Second Amendment for a very good reason, and that was to protect you the citizen, not only from daily crimes, but from any tyrannical government that may ever pop up.

Considering that it’s human nature to strive for greater interaction, online casino platform providers have managed to identify several ways to retain and increase player traffic. Live dealer games offer the ultimate level of interactivity with the remaining participants, i.e. the game dealer and the remaining players on your table. If you haven’t experienced the live dealer games available online, you should know to expect a real-life person and table transmitted onto your computer screen instead of the usual graphic design setup. How Do Live Dealer Casino Games Work? In order to function optimally, the live dealer game selection at online casinos does not depend on the same operator. Namely, this technology is still developing and improving, which is why there are only a handful of third-party live dealer game software providers that regulate all its settings and technical support. In terms of requirements, live dealer casino games may be said to be somewhat demanding, even though players using an average computing setup could access and enjoy them. Mobile online casino players, however, are still unable to access live dealer casino games properly, as currently manufactured mobile devices don’t have enough bandwidth to run and support them. This means that you will be able to enjoy such entertainment at the comfort of your own home, or any place that allows you to take your laptop. Regardless of the location and device you choose, there is one criterion that needs to be met in order to ensure the games will run smoothly – the players’ Internet connection. It is highly advisable to use Wi-Fi as a connection, but only from a reliable and secure provider, and ensure that high volumes of traffic are available, as it can use up to a few GBs from your monthly subscription. Which Types of Live Dealer Casino Games Are Available? So far, not all casino games have been adapted to the live dealer mode, but those that have been are blackjack, roulette, baccarat and poker. Blackjack games have no trouble attracting online casino players, but this live mode is definitely ‘the real deal’. Live blackjack is played using actual card decks, which are shuffled in a real life shoe, and dealt by a dealer. Should you have a few blackjack strategies up your sleeve, live dealer blackjack is the best place to use them as it provides the least chance for others to note them. Live dealer roulette is available in all its standard versions – European, American and, on some occasions French Roulette, which offers the best odds for its players due to the number of characteristic betting possibilities. Baccarat is also suited to this specific format, especially since dealing and betting moves are applied without anyone noticing that you still haven’t handled all the rules. As for poker, Texas Hold’em is arguably the most popular variant, but as live dealer games are progressing, so is the number of poker game types available in this format.'], ['Exclusive Footage From Wakanda South Africa Parliament Persecuting White Farmers', 'As the exodus of white farmers continues from South Africa, the country is descending back to the law of the jungle.

F or American invitees to the wedding of his Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales and Ms. Meghan Markle at the chapel in Windsor Castle, these careful words of advice are hereinafter given to provide some pointers to avoid gaffes on your part. “Hi, buddy” is not considered a proper greeting to the Prince, nor “Hi, there” to Meghan. With the British, first names are not used at once as if you are drinking pals. In the case of the Prince and Meghan, this means you cannot address them as “Harry” and “Meghan” (let alone, “Har” and “Meg”). If the conversation becomes boring, it is not considered normal behavior to begin fingering objects at the reception and checking their bottoms for prices. An occasional nod of the head will give the impression of paying attention. Appraising the women’s legs is a no-no. When tea is served, as it invariably is, it will be brought in a cup. Nor should the saucer which accompanies the cup be considered an unnecessary accoutrement; the saucer should not be waived away with distain, nor should you say you prefer “a brew” instead. The little finger should not be pointed (and certainly never at the prince or the bride) but curled in raising the cup, and the index finger should not be extended in lieu thereof, even in emphasizing a conversational point. Actually, points are not emphasized in England, rather they are nudged into place. Napkins are also served, and the mouth should be patted, never swiped at. Sweeping gestures are frowned on. The last sweeping gesture made by an Englishman was that of Sir Walter Raleigh in spreading his cloak for Queen Elizabeth (the First) to walk on, and he subsequently lost his head. The English are a reticent race. Do not pepper them with a lot of rapid-fire talk. On the other hand, you may doze until they finish their sentences, and mumbling is also tolerated, which facilitates answering them if you are in the midst of a tart which the English dote on. Do not ask for a Big Mac instead. The English cannot abide shouting, so your normal speaking voice must be modulated. An alternative technique is to stand further back from your conversant than you do in the U.S. This can only enhance your status, as the English frown on familiarity. Do not worry that you will not be heard, for many Englishmen are equipped with ear-trumpets, a habit no doubt stemming from their use as mouth-trumpets during fox hunts. Touching the English when speaking with them is absolutely forbidden. This touchiness derives (in the case of males) from their public school days, in which such physicality was regarded as a discreet overture. When presented to an Englishman, especially if titled, it is not considered proper to thereupon inquire as to his salary or the cost of his residence, nor even (if it is not abundantly clear) what he does for a living. Many titled Englishman do nothing for a living, nor are they expected to. Caveat: If you are presented to a Lord, do not commence to mention your own favorite schemes for investment. Don’t try to purchase London Bridge as a souvenir. Finally, a general rule: when in doubt, adopt passivity.

The internet is slowly being purged of free thought and freedom of expression by monopoly companies that control 95% of everything now on the world wide web. All there is is silence. No one apart from a few sites and people are speaking up or doing anything about it. Well if you don’t stand up for your rights, then one day you will be next, one day you will be censored, demonetized and deleted, or relegated to page 3,000 in search. Who will speak up for you then? NO ONE! As well as Martin Niemöller’s words that ring so true in this insane Orwellian age, we can also mention Edmund Burke who famously stated — “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” How ironic that Google once said that it’s motto was: “Don’t be Evil” Just as Google has censored our satire and parody so too is China. In retrospect, what is happening right now is beyond evil, because what these monopoly tech companies and their extreme leftist policies are doing is in fact aligning with communist Chinese censorship and its destructive dictatorial ideology. And here we thought we lived in a functioning Western democracy where we had rights of free speech? Alas, the tech companies like twitter, facebook and google have demonstrated otherwise by inhibiting our fundamental rights to human expression and freedom.

Fishermen and Tory MPs took part in the protest after the Government caved to demands from Brussels that Britain remain in the Common Fisheries Policy until 31 December 2020. The climbdown over the transition deal means that the UK will be subject to quotas imposed on British fishermen from the EU for an additional 21 months. Setting off shortly after 8am, the fishing vessel HMS Brexit set sail under Tower Bridge towards Parliament, carrying more than a dozen journalists and fishermen ready to fling the wet fish into the Thames. Sold Britain down the river “She kept trying to justify capitulating to Brussels and being a wet fish. She’s sold us all down the river with this terrible transition deal which will see our fishermen scuppered,” a protester said before the flinging commenced. Just like everything else, wet fish, Theresa May was pathetic even to the end, and as the Tories and fishermen lifted her up, she blubbed like a soppy sodden sponge. With an almighty splash, the wet fish first sank, then rose, drowned, floating silently down the river that has for centuries been the heart and soul of the capital.'], ['Don’t Drop the Soap – Sarkozy in Le Prison', 'Ooh la la! Mon dieu! Is it true, oui, c’est vrai! Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, has been put behind bars in prison. Sarkozy is in custody as part of an investigation that he received millions of euros in illegal financing from the regime of the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, according to a judicial source. “I told him, he needs to clean the money. Sarko, would not listen to me and deposited the millions in a French bank. He thought he was untouchable because he was part of the French elite,” a former associate revealed. Though an investigation has been underway since 2013, the case gained traction some three years later when French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told the online investigative site, Mediapart, that he delivered suitcases from Libya containing 5 million euros in cash to Sarkozy and his former chief of staff Claude Gueant. Investigators are examining claims that Gadhafi’s regime secretly gave Sarkozy 50 million euros overall for the 2007 campaign. Such a sum would be more than double the legal campaign funding limit at the time of 21 million euros. In addition, the alleged payments would violate French rules against foreign financing and declaring the source of campaign funds. French prisons are full to the brim of young African men who have not had a piece of ass for a long time, so Sarkozy will be fresh white meat thrown to the dogs. “He better not pick up the soap in the showers,” a former inmate revealed.'], ['Is It Safe To Buy Injections From Clinic Without Consulting A Doctor? ', 'Hormones are chemicals produced by the body. They are very small, however powerful, and lack or excess of them can cost one health. Hormones directly influence the majority of organs and tissues, physical and chemical processes, even state of mind and emotions. For example, the most powerful hormones in the human body are: Adrenaline; Testosterone, Human Growth Hormone; Estrogen; Insulin; Cortisol. When these or other hormones are disbalanced, hormone replacement therapy is one of the treatment options. Hormones can be provided in pills, injections, patches, etc. While some people believe that having a diagnosis and knowing what hormone is lacking or in excess is enough to go an buy a medicine on their own, this is totally incorrect. To provide proper treatment, years of experience and profound knowledge in medical field are needed. So, to buy proper pills, patches or injections, go to https://www.hgha.com/ and consult a doctor first. it may even turn out that what you believe is endocrine system problem is actually not, and additional intake of hormones will ruin your health even more. Why You Can’t Get Injection Of Your Own Choice In order to attract clients, pharmaceutical companies started to produce different injections that aim to increase the level of certain hormone in the body. The patients who need injections can theoretically buy those and do injections at home, without need to visit the clinic. However, these injections are and should be sold only after proper research, analysis and calculation of dosage. Here are some reasons why you should not get injections without doctor’s prescription: To decide what injection is correct, the doctor has to make a full medical screening. In order to improve the level of hormone in the body, any injection dosage is not the option. The processes can only be changed in a needed way if the components of injection correspond to particular body needs. You can’t calculate the dosage yourself. General prescriptions are not enough. Each patient’s endocrine profile is different. You have to consult the doctor if you want to get the medicine that will really help you. The efficiency and influence of hormones should be constantly supervised and the indications should be measured, to check the progress and adjust the treatment plan if needed. The dosage may need to be changed already in two weeks, or another medication should be offered. Without proper education and experience, a patient cannot conduct such observation. These reasons show that you can only get the injections by doctor’s prescription. Otherwise, you will simply ruin your health. What Doctor To Address Not all endocrinologists who work in clinics are able to prescribe the right hormone treatment, in other words, only being a doctor in a clinic is not enough. A professional doctor has to have years of practice in the field, having worked specifically as endocrinologist. The doctor also has to have appropriate certification from relevant authorities confirming him as a specialist. medical diploma is not yet an indicator of proper knowledge and skills. It is always a good idea to ask your friends about contacts of a good doctor; the word of mouth is a good recommendation in this case. If the doctor or clinic is awful, people will readily tell you so. The treatment methods, medications and approaches also develop constantly. The scientists discover new options, and modern doctors have to be posted about the innovations. Pharmaceutical companies develop new products that have to be checked, tested, certified, assessed, modified, and doctors take part in all that, too. Therefore, the doctor has to be really experienced to provide proper diagnosis, treatment plan and patient support. Choose your doctor and clinic wisely.'], ['Putin Celebrates Another Election Win With Botox', 'Who would have thought, the supreme Vlad, has won another election.

The Russian despot’s eyebags now make his face look so puffed up, he resembles a smiling Cheshire cat in every photo. “Along with his glass of polonium which he drinks every day, our supreme leader, Czar Puto, undergoes botox treatment for his face.

October, 2017 Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to move the current Manchester Labour HQ to Moscow, Russia has come under scrutiny from some Labour MPs. Speaking at the Manchester HQ, Reggie Dwumble, MP for South Lanarkshire, was slightly precarious about the move. “Jeremy said that we would all have to speak Russian. There are so many Russians in Britain today, that’s the only language I usually hear when in the streets, but I can’t learn it. To me it sounds like someone who has marbles permanently stuck in their throat.” The move to Moscow, planned for June, 2018, will involve every item within the HQ shipped to Russia. The Labour party has secured the correct papers for the transfer, and were given fast lane status by the Russian consulate. Vladimir Sikorsky, a Russian embassy envoy was on hand to explain the fine details of the move. “You need hats. In Moscow it very cold. Also, you need to be able to drink large quantities of vodka without falling down. Us Russian, we can drink three bottles a day without getting tipsy, but you British will have to learn the Russian way. Also, you have to know about food shopping, in our shops food very expensive, only VIP oligarch can shop there. In some Moscow markets, one tomato is equivalent to £7.50.” Jeremy Corbyn, however, has sought to calm the nerves of his staff and followers. “Comrades, as your supreme Agent Cob, I wish to assuage any form of terror you may be feeling right now when I announced the Moscow move. Remember that I am doing this to get back to our roots, and also because I’m a commie bastard who subscribes to Marxist ideology.”'], ['#YouAsWell Hashtag Trending With #WhoCares and #GetOverYourself', 'This week’s twitter hashtag trend has shown a movement away from the victim-led #MeToo tag that had women crying about things like someone asking them out on a date, to hashtags like #YouAsWell, #WhoCares and #GetOverYourself which dealt with people who are fed up of the hysteria. One twitter user, 98Arbunkin was certain that the #MeToo generation of #snowflakes were more of a danger to themselves with their constant moaning and groaning. “Why don’t they just shut up. If you have a legitimate problem, or someone has seriously done you wrong, molested you, raped you, go to the police. Don’t write it on twitter. We don’t care anymore. Get over yourselves for fuck’s sake.” Professor Giles Timberlik, a social media expert at the University of Kentucky Fry in Austin, Texas, has conducted data driven studies into the #MeToo phenomenon of caterwauling women. “It’s simply a way for the hysterical bags of oestrogen to moan about men by using twitter to put the spotlight on the person who uses the hashtag to moan about men. Like look at me I am one of you, I don’t like men either. Hey, look at my profile. Look at me. Look at my beautiful assortment of selfies.” Attention whores This is why paying attention to the #metoo posters is adding fuel to the fire. It is in fact taking women’s rights back to the stone age. “I just won’t employ women any more. It’s that simple. I need people that work, don’t get pregnant and don’t moan about the simplest of things like complimenting her, or asking her out on a date. If they don’t want to be employed, it’s their problem, not mine,” a video production suite manager, who deals with many Hollywood productions told LAWeek magazine. Women who profit from their looks should deal with the fact that they are using their looks to make money, and they are attractive to men. Mosher Libavitz, an agent who caters for Hollywood celebrities is just as sick of #metoo as everyone else. “I see actresses come here, tits hanging out, a dress up to her waist, and they complain to me that men look at them. She said she posted #metoo in disgust. Then she got down on both knees in my office and asked if I got her a part in the latest Spielberg film, she will do this, and that, licking her lips. I said, okay, then after she finished I told her to leave. She did not get the part, so then she posts on twitter that I raped her,” Mr. Libavitz said from jail yesterday.'], ['Downing Street: Agent Cob Could be Expelled From UK', 'It has been a nightmare 24 hours for Agent Cob (aka Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn). First he was told that the security forces were on to his double dealing with the Russians, then his own party started to question his soviet orders. Here is an agent who prided himself in his meticulous espionage techniques of hiding under plain sight, exposed for the whole world to see. Issuing a statement to the House of Commons, Agent Cob was adamant that he was innocent to all accusations of spying for the Russians. “I am not a spy. I have not handed secrets or any form of information to the Russians, now or at any time in the past,” Agent Cob said emphatically. Then someone in the audience coughed loudly whilst uttering the word “Bullshit!”. Tenterhooks It is yet to be seen whether Agent Cob will be expelled back to Russia, as he may abscond and disappear once again into the unknown to continue plotting his return. MI6 operative, St John Sinclair, (Agent 00x) has other thoughts. “Agent Cob has been responsible for many leaks that have compromised British national security. If he won’t go back to Russia after being expelled, we’ll just have to get Q branch onto him. They have many contraptions that can delete Agent Cob without even a trace. We are certainly not as messy as our Russian friends when it comes to erasing erroneous assets.”'], ['Poverty Stricken Russians Still Using Old Soviet Military Equipment', 'The majority of military Russians, except for a few portions still subscribe to the old Soviet conscript model and are seriously lax in modern fighting methods or equipment. This is why a ground war with Russia would be a fait accomplis for the crumbling old facade of the poverty stricken rabble that is the Russian army. Yes, Putin can always threaten complete nuclear annihilation of the earth with his grandiose killer missiles, but even he does not want that. His aim, even if it is deluded, is to conquer the West intact so he can be the ultimate Czar of the world with Russian supremacy over all. Modernization needs money, and this is where Russia ultimately falls down. The country, now an International pariah, is sanctioned to the hilt, and its primary revenue streams are diverted by corrupt oligarchs offshore. “Our unit has two rifles to practice with. I asked my commanding officer what would happen in combat, and he told me that we would have to share the old Soviet rifles together, maybe one chap takes a shot, then another might think he can do better. So you pass the rifles around the unit, or if someone is killed and he is holding the rifle, you pick it up and carry on until the whole unit perishes,” Sergei Olkov, a private in Russia’s second division stationed in the Northeastern Group in the Kamchatka Peninsula revealed. To go into battle with today’s modern forces would mostly be suicide for the poor Russian conscripts, who are so ill trained, they don’t even have the capacity to understand the basic battle tactics or maneuvers most other forces utilise to win over the enemy. Only about a quarter of Russian ground forces are fully staffed, well-trained professional troops. The rest are a mishmash of units put together, some don’t even have uniforms, and serve in their tracksuits. They have never even fired live weapons or had access to specialist military equipment. One only has to look at the graveyard of Afghanistan to see the abandoned Soviet tanks and Migs, revealing the realities of how poorly performing the Russians were even when fighting old men in huts carrying 19th century single shot rifles. “The Russian boys would be seen frolicking around in their camps, they run around naked, drunk, slapping each others butts, and doing god knows what to each other. When they came out to patrol once a week, I would shoot one round into the sky. Then they would run away with real fear in their eyes. To us, these were not men but girls,” a Pashtun warrior chief, recalled. Naturally, Putin only sent the cream of the crop to the recent Syrian conflict as a showcase for the world’s media, however these only make up one percent of the current Russian army. What of the conflict in Ukraine? Putin cannot even advance from the small pockets of land he has illegally occupied, as his troops are so weak. All the talk about Russia this, Russia that. It’s all hysteria, smoke and mirrors. There is no threat from Russia on the ground or in the air. If the West wanted to, they could cut through Russia faster than a babushka cuts through her tepid cabbage soup with a mouldy wooden spoon. How about a trip on the ageing only Russian aircraft carrier, the Soviet-era Admiral Kuznetsov. Basically it is an old rust bucket which breaks down frequently and needs its own tug to tow it back to shore on practically every voyage it goes on. This some say is why Russians drink so much vodka, because inherently they are cowards, and have to be so drunk to even get the guts to pick up a weapon let alone shoot it.

Well, the England boys are all suited up and ready for today’s training. Their destination is the 2018 World Cup in Russia, which will be a serious test for the team. After a few minutes, there’s a breakaway, Jordan Henderson, the Liverpool midfielder suddenly checks his run, and parries through an instep drive towards centre. Unfortunately, due to the Hazmat suit, his shot hits a stopper, and the opposing side now delve deep into territorial danger bossing the game. After angling to the sweeper, then square passing to Harry Kane who runs the ball right up to the opposition’s line of retreat just outside the penalty box, he suddenly collapses with extreme heat exhaustion and cannot move. The goalie breathes a sigh of relief. The perils of this dangerous endeavour are ever present. Half the team can barely run for fifteen minutes before suffering from heat exhaustion and fatigue wearing the heavy suits. “It’s hard on the legs especially. Plus you try spitting phlegm in a Hazmat? You can’t spit, you can barely run, and your field of vision is shot to shit,” Jamie Carragher says from the sidelines. It’s half time and the boys are knackered. There’s no way you can eat an orange segment let alone have a smoke in a fucking Hazmat. Second half Gareth Southgate, the manager comes out of his hut at 56 minutes and presses a red button. It’s a chemical nerve agent test to see if the England squad will survive. If they have their Hazmat suits on and in proper nick, then it should be okay. Oh dear, one of the boys goes down, the gas got through a little gap as he didn’t put his head dress on properly. Poor bastard, looks like Rose, Tottenham left-back. He is carted off the pitch twitching like an altar boy in a Catholic church. After a few minutes the medics administer the antidote and the foam stops coming out of his mouth. He’s okay. “I wanted to test the team. What if we’re two goals up on Russia, and they suddenly send in their nerve gas while we’re at the other end of the pitch to the Russian team? This is why it is essential our boys wear these suits. Not only could it save our lives but we could win games whilst under chemical attack, the cowardly Russians are dirty players, but we won’t let them get us,” Southgate later revealed. You’ve got to hand it to the brave players for the England squad.

Professor Haley Baum, has shocked the world’s vegetarians and vegans with the research data. “Our initial analysis process was to determine electrical nano-pulse feedback from plants when harvested from the ground. We found that when a plant is uprooted from the earth it has stood in from seed, the plant lets off a high pitched sound above any human register, along with electrical impulses. This reaction led us to hypothesise that the plant was not happy about being uprooted and was in effect screaming for its life. “We then moved on to vegetables being first cut, then eaten. We attached a series of meters and electrical signal sequencers to each vegetable. The noisiest scream and electrical impulse came from a tomato. Each cut of the blade through its flesh would register a shock impulse denoting extreme distress, then when the tomato was put in the mouth and slowly chewed the distress signal increased until slowly ebbing away. “Bananas being peeled are in pain. It is akin to skinning a living animal. Scraping the skin off carrots, we registered the yelps of pain and distress. Putting fruit in a blender however resulted in no electrical impulse or sound, because death came quickly.” Salad It is thought that meat eaters are the cruel ones, but think about those grapes, maybe that slice of lemon, or that watermelon you just sliced and diced. This new revelation by scientists may change our eating habits forever. Maybe fruit and vegetables will have to be stunned first before meal preparation. Restaurateurs are not happy with the new scientific data. Many who were consulted, said that this would mean many meals for customers would take longer to prepare costing them millions in lost revenue. All living things feel pain, and anguish, especially when they are cut up, doused in the finest balsamic vinegar, then thrust unceremoniously into your mouth.

Then there was New York on February 27, at Weworks, and Milan on February 23 at the Anteo Palazzo del Cinema. Press coverage in 2017 was extensive, but the Epica Awards in 2018 will no doubt be more pervasive, creating even more of a tectonic buzz around these exclusive awards.

Recently, the monopolistic tech companies like Google and Facebook started to clamp down on free speech, freedom of expression, satire, and other forms of literature. This totalitarian policy was once only seen in China’s communist dictatorship, and censoring regime. Put two and two together and you have globalism led by China. This means that the tech companies are actually following Chinese communistic techniques in limiting freedom of speech, censorship and dictating what people can and cannot say. Therefore, one can see that there is a shift to soviet communism by the tech companies, who are pandering to China’s globalistic aspirations to take over the West. The tech companies are not doing this only for money, but one suspects that they actually subscribe to Chinese communist doctrine. In relation to the communist doctrine that encapsulates China, some tech companies even happily report dissidents to Chinese authorities. Twitter and Google have both done this, which resulted in the dissidents disappearing, never to be seen again. The Chinese authorities can only get the data about someone’s details, from Twitter or Google, therefore they collaborate with the communist regime in arresting individuals who are critical of the state. China’s awful human rights record is of course glossed over when it comes to profit, and so is the treatment of Tibetans who have been tortured, killed and displaced by the brutal communist Chinese state. Imagine being abducted and whisked away to a cell where you spend the next several months or years with no charge or conviction, and your organs harvested. Communist Chinese brutality puts down any talk of democracy, freedom of expression or free speech. This is very similar to how the Western tech monopolies are acting right now.

Often when people meet online they keep a friendship for many years or even for the whole lifetime. Getting friends online has some important benefits: You can find special people whom you can hardly meet in your regular surrounding. Often people find their second halves online. You can get to know people with different beliefs. On the Internet social, cultural and religious borders do not exist. You can get to know an Indian person who is British.

Such websites oblige people who want to register to present their personal photos and scan versions of passport. That is a very efficient way to check if the person is real or not. Another threat that exists in the virtual space is personal details disclosure. Often in virtual space, the information simply leaks. If you would like to protect your personal data, you need to check Confidentiality policy of a given platform. You should find the clause that states that the web-platform won’t pass your personal details to third parties. Virtual space opens great opportunities. Though, it is important to use it accurately.

October, 2017 Former Soviet spy, Jeremy Corbyn, or as he was known ‘Agent Cob‘ could use poison to silence any critics of the Labour manifesto, and he could target opposition MPs if they question his communist ideals, a leading terror expert has revealed. Michael Trimbell, who runs an anti-terror unit for different agencies, has revealed that Agent Cob is “a master in poison techniques, learned from his Cold War days spying for the Russians”. “Russian spies, and Agent Cob’s Czech handler would have trained Agent Cob in various techniques to clandestinely kill adversaries without detection. This included concocting poison from everyday materials, then depositing it in the target’s drink. Agent Cob, would then watch from afar as his mark either keeled over on the spot or swerved around like a drunk. These techniques are utilised by today’s FSB, and yesterday’s KGB very successfully.” KGB operatives could incapacitate opponents by usage of aerosol spray containing lethal cocktails of dangerous toxic gases or from afar with a silent air gun shooting a needle infused with poison into the victim. The tiny needle would enter the skin undetected, then dissolve. Once the poison gets into the bloodstream it kills the victim by stopping the heart, then dissipates without any trace, leaving doctors and forensic scientists labelling the death as a simple natural heart attack. “One minute you’re walking along the High Street, the next your blood pressure drops, and you’re out of breath sweating like a pig. Then your heart stops. Voom! That’s it, and to compound the issue, absolutely no traces of how you died.” MPs in Westminster are naturally quite fearful of Agent Cob, knowing his history and when he is around, they are advised to cover their drinks. “If I see Jeremy shuffling his way around the canteen looking around, I immediately cover my drink. Here is an ex-Soviet spy who leaked secrets to the Soviets in the 1980s, and not only is he among us MPs, he is also the leader of the Labour party. Frankly, I find it exceedingly scary, just the thought that this traitor to Britain is in the Commons looking shifty,” a scared MP who dared to speak of Agent Cob, revealed anonymously.'], ['Oscars: “..and the Mangina Award Goes to..”', 'What’s safe today in the era of bland, Kimmel, puritan, America? Men with no penises. Enter, talkshow host, Jimmy Kimmel, a safe bet for the Oscars, which has now been sanitised, and reduced to a bare shell of puritanical socialist rhetoric that decries masculinity and the biological right of men to own a penis. Propaganda Suffice to say that Kanye West’s mother-in-law has more testosterone than the emasculated mangina, Kimmel, who has ingratiated himself in the ways of soviet-style equality propaganda pushes that are ongoing in social media. Hollywood has thus gone from one extreme to another, from being sexy, to being completely Victorian in its attitude. If one knows their history however, the Victorians indulged in lots of sex in private, however prudish and puritanical they seemed in public. Neutering the essence of Hollywood is thus the role Kimmel has in mind, and he certainly does a good job brown nosing to the Marxist equality commission in charge of emasculating all men in the media. Let us cut off all men’s penises and castrate all men, they cry to loud applause from the compliant drone audience. Well, in that case, you first Jimmy Kimmel, you snivelling yellow gelding, cut off your manhood, and walk the talk.'], ['Bravo Italia! Could the Italian People Break Free From EU Prison?', 'Angry African illegal immigrants demonstrate their right to illegally immigrate to Italy The EU much like the Mafia, is almost impossible to extricate from. In the Mafia, there are only two ways to exit, death or betrayal and lifelong anonymity looking over your shoulder. The EU, we have seen is much like the same as the Mafiosi. The EU winds and side steps at every point avoiding any form of exit of a country it has imprisoned within its economic steel walls. It is a prison without walls you can see, but the walls are there nevertheless. There is only one way of exiting the EU, that is through non-conformity and disobeying its Stasi rules. That is the only way to go with some form of dignity anyway. Yes, there are other avenues, but these mean that you never leave the strongarm leash of the EU, and are forever tied to its prison rules. The jailers are the unelected European Union officials of the EU Commission, who are pampered denizens of high class escorts, unlimited expense accounts and international luxury travel. Naturally, these elite few at the top enjoy their vast pay packets, their 18-year-old ladies ushered into their hotel rooms, and their daily gourmet food in Europe’s finest restaurants. The members of the EU Commission do not want one of their cash cow countries, which provide good tax revenue, to leave.

The statistics show that the vast majority are unwilling to discuss this, with most claiming they would much prefer to discuss other taboo subjects, such as politics and religion, in order to avoid talking about it altogether. Helen Fisher, the chief scientific advisor behind the research, suggested that online daters just don’t want to have that all-important money talk, with the only associated topic they’re comfortable discussing being their career. Keeping quiet about our cash Source: Max Pixel The study in question focused on respondents who were either actively using a dating platform or had met their partner online at Badoo or something similar. When questioned about the subjects they felt comfortable exploring, the vast majority felt similarly about their finances i.e. that they were ‘not comfortable at all’ sharing this information with those they met. The numbers were revealing, with 69 percent claiming they would not wish to disclose information about any debts, and the same number clarifying that they would want to keep their credit score to themselves. 64 percent also said that they weren’t comfortable sharing their income, with 53 percent saying the same of their spending habits. Even more revealingly, perhaps, 18 percent believed that discussing their finances had led to previous break-ups. Fisher suggests that this is because money tends to be a very personal topic, one that “says so much about you.” Expanding on this statement, the study’s lead posited that, for all of us, it is a way of getting clues about our partner, helping us to build a better picture of what they’ll be like as a parent, friend, and significant other. A close-lipped society Source: Max Pixel Given the importance of the topic, one might argue that – discomfort aside – it is essential to talk about it, yet one in five Americans never have such a conversation with their other half. Unfortunately for them, this can have a highly detrimental impact on their monetary health. As expert Greg Heller explains: “The major benefit of speaking about money is getting the subject out in the open.” He argues that this can help to engender a sense of relief, in that people are able to not only discuss their situation, but also any fears or financial insecurities they might have. This sharing can help them to make better decisions, set obtainable goals, and work together as a team to build a stronger financial future. This is a view that Discover’s Kate Manfred agrees with, suggesting that it’s vital to talk about money early on in order to ensure your outlooks align. With it playing such a large part in serious relationships, it means that you can get onto the same page from the start and don’t have to worry about running into problems further down the line. How would you feel about discussing such a topic with your partner?

This 4m2f contest is hugely popular as once a year, punters love placing a bet on this race, regardless of whether they choose form, colours or a name to make their selection. Here is an early look at the horses that stand out from the entries for the 2018 renewal next month. Total Recall The bookmakers look to have got the betting right for the Grand National this year as Total Recall tops the betting at 10/1 to come out on top over the big fences at Aintree and it is really hard to oppose him. The Ladbrokes Trophy winner has won all three of his starts this season and he is trained by the maestro himself, Willie Mullins. This Irish raider could improve for the step up in trip and with Ruby Walsh, who will be seeking his third Grand National winner, on his back in the race, there is so much to like about him. Definitly Red One of the classiest horses to the Grand National field this year is Definitely Red as his form this season is good enough for him to take his chance at the Cheltenham Festival, where he has been backed into 10/1 in the Cheltenham Gold Cup betting. If he is unable to prevail at the Festival, don’t rule him out to gain compensation at Aintree as he should love the stamina test the race presents. Brian Ellison’s chaser has already had two fantastic wins so far in the season as he was successful in the Many Clouds Chase and Cotswold Chase. At nine years old, he is the perfect age to have a shot at the feature race at Aintree, where he is as big as 20/1. The Last Samuri The Last Samuri went close to slaying his rivals in the 2016 Grand National when he finished second in the 40 runner field behind Rule the World. Last year’s attempt was not quite as good, however, as he got around the course again. In four attempts over the Grand National fences, The Last Samuri has always finished his race; he is a very reliable operator. With a bit of luck this year, he could well be the first past the post. At 20/1 in the betting, he represents one of the best each-way bets next month. Vicente Vicente is a two-time Scottish Grand National winning after landing the race at Ayr in 2016 and 2017, which shows he has the stamina for the four-mile plus races on the calendar in the UK and Ireland. Unfortunately, Paul Nicholls’ runner did not participate for long last year as he came down at the very first fence after making a mistake. If you can forgive that error, he is very much overpriced at 33/1. The nine-year-old often produces his best form at the back end of the season so hopefully, he can come good at Aintree this time around. The 2018 Grand National takes place on April 14, but betting is already open on the race if you want to get your money down early.'], ['Communist China Behind Google Facebook Global Censorship Push', 'Extreme left wing hierarchical elements in tech companies like Google and Facebook are pandering to communist China by the massive global censorship push that is going on right now. If you run a site that does not exhibit Maoist communist or Marxist rhetoric then you will wonder why your site got deleted from YouTube or Facebook, or was demonetised by Google on Adsense. This is because the Chinese are taking over the internet right now, and the China market is too lucrative for the tech companies to ignore. It’s already too late as the back deals have been done between high ranking communist party officials and the likes of Google. Sadly, this also signals the end of free speech on the Internet, as the good old days when every opinion was allowed, will soon be a thing of the past. Free speech and its loss will go down the road of privacy, where there is none today. Millennials, for example do not know what privacy is, and the next generation will not know freedom of speech. YouTube, which is now owned by Google, used to be a nice site. Now it is a miserable soup of Orwellian Marxist censorship where extreme left wing groups like Snopes, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Defamation League have been given carte blanche to dictate what is allowed and what is not. These censors ultimately follow Chinese communistic dictatorial processes in their censorship. Suffice to say, any differing opinion to Maoist communist ideology is defined as ‘hate speech’ an all encompassing term used to censor freedom of expression, art, satire, political opinion. Therefore, globally, it now looks like China, this great communist juggernaut that has been nurtured and allowed to grow by the West like some huge puss filled pustule, has effectively conquered the Western ideals of democracy through the back door, the tech companies, which already have a monopolistic octopus grip over every facet of the Internet, are following the route of totalitarian dictatorial regimes like communist China. Ladies and gentlemen, we have been sold out, we have been betrayed, and there is nothing we can do about it now. It is too late. The tenets of Western democracy, free speech, and free expression are now officially dead. Unfortunately, it’s only going to get a lot worse from now on.

In order to win, the gambler has to possess considerable emotional stability. He needs to stay calm when losing and never get overly emotional during the game. The chance to win in gambling depends much on what personal qualities the gambler has. Strong personality plus advanced knowledge of gambling strategies bring success to the player. In order to understand how good you are as a potential gambler, try Gratis-spinn as an example of online casino house to test your luck. Successful players often are very emotionally stable people. They have strong personalities and this is their competitive advantage. They are fearless and very determined. Successful gamblers never overestimate their chances in the game. They keep neutral attitude until the end. It is also good to keep in mind that big winnings happens rarely. Successful gambler is not the one who wins each single game. A successful player is the one who does not lose belief in himself facing failures. Statistics show you have to gamble multiple times in order to win a considerable sum of money, but it is still possible. What Is Needed To Become A Good Gambler Being a gambler is almost like having a profession. The person who gambles has to possess: Knowledge in the field. For many, gambling seems to be an issue of luck. However, lucky gamblers use multiple strategies in order to succeed; it is especially applicable for card games and table games. Right personal qualities. Each person is individualistic, but most successful players have much in common. Sharp intelligence and fine personal qualities help the player succeed in game. Players often have to spend much time to improving their knowledge and personal qualities as well. The well-known “poker face” is an example of emotional skill needed to mask one’s feelings about his cards when playing poker. Personal Qualities That Determine The Professional Player Strong personal qualities are indispensable in gambling. They include, but are not limited to: Strong determination. For a person to be self-determined, it takes real effort. However, it is worth it. Self-determined player follows the goal. If his goal is to win, he will test his luck multiple times. He knows that sooner or later he will get the winning. Being adventurous. It is the personal quality that is hard to develop. Usually there are two types of people. Ones risk without thinking before it, the others are simply too afraid to undertake risk. Successful players are not afraid to risk, but also evaluate their decisions before risking. Being self-motivated. Motivation is key to success in any business. For the successful player it is important to find his source of motivation. It is also important to know exactly what motivates you. Personal qualities often determine whether the person will be successful or not, whether it is in gambling or in any other field. However, in gambling, where much depends on pure luck, personal qualities are able to add at least a bit more to the chances of winning.'], ['‘John Major is NOT Exceptional!’ Say the British People', 'Former Conservative PM, John Major The will of the majority of the British people on June 23, 2016 was to LEAVE the EU.

Without any overt macho imagery or inclination, creative director, Luke Crissell accomplishes the delicate subject of what it is to be a man. #metoo people may scoff and scowl at the ad, and may even try to ban it as it shows a tender view of masculinity, but this may be a sign that the anti-male hatred that we have had to endure for years is slowly ebbing away. In a world where regular men are derided, hated upon and punished, there is no wonder that male suicide is at record levels, where at every turn in the media and social networks men are continually attacked and denigrated. With fertility dropping at drastic rates in the industrialised world, resulting in low birthrates, many Western nations have effectively shot themselves in the foot by their overt push to emasculate and denigrate men. Sadly the ad agencies catered to this anti-male hysteria and hatred by peddling adverts that portrayed this view.

It was also revealed how he was told to carry a squash ball when meeting his handler, who would wear a pair of gloves and carry a red carnation as a “recognition signal”. On another occasion he was instructed to meet his Soviet contacts at a certain table in the Stags Head pub in Islington, north London, and would signal his Soviet handlers by clicking his heels seven and a half times, then spinning around four times whilst whistling the East German anthem a semitone above its normal register. When in parliament, if MP Jeremy Corbyn picked his nose twice, this would reveal a signal to spies that Margaret Thatcher would not be attending that day, however if he picked his nose then ate the bogie, this signal meant she would be attending. However, if he picked his nose, then smeared the bogie on another MP’s jacket, this would mean the PM would be delayed by a few minutes. If in danger, Corbyn would signal to his Soviet masters by clucking like a chicken then conducting a series of semi-circle maneuvers whilst simultaneously dragging his left foot behind him and jumping slightly to the left. Highly Trained Soviet Operative According to former Soviet spymasters, Jeremy Corbyn was also trained in the usage of many spy tools including special gadgets like listening devices, carrier pigeons and abseiling techniques. Trained in the dark espionage arts, Corbyn would casually pass on British state secrets to his handlers via carrier pigeon. The specially trained pigeons would be acquired at Trafalgar Square after midnight from on top of the fourth lion statue to the right, then flown to clandestine addresses across London. House of Commons The files, released for the first time, disclosed how Corbyn revealed details of Margaret Thatcher’s movements and if she was wearing underwear or not on the day of attendance at the House of Commons. This information was crucial to the Soviets for some reason, and Agent Cob never questioned why. If Maggie was wearing underwear on the day of attendance, this would be signalled by Jeremy Corbyn with a series of grunts, and he would hold his breath for a few minutes until his face went red. If Corbyn saw that Mrs Thatcher had not worn any underwear, by utilising his Soviet mirror gadget, he would hoot like an owl, then scratch his crotch four times whilst moving backwards. One of Corbyn’s contacts, Agent 9, would hold a red book in his hands whenever they met. This signal meant that it was okay to talk freely, however if he held a black book, this would mean that they had to go elsewhere to converse. Corbyn was also trained in stealth techniques, as well as military grade combat. His shoes were specially fitted with spikes laced with deadly poison, and would be deployed by clicking the heels three times. As a last resort, Agent Cob was also given a cyanide pill just in case he was ever found out by the British secret services and interrogated.'], ['Stasi Britain: Cold War Soviet Spy Comrade Corbyn Threatens Press Censorship', 'Former Cold War Soviet spy, Comrade Corbyn is angry with the media after being outed as an informant to Soviet Russia recently. Speaking at his dacha in Islington, the supreme leader of the Labour party said that “changes would be coming” to press freedom. Analyst, Borgmer Lynns, revealed the truth of Corbyn’s deadly message. “What Corbyn is effectively saying is he will squash press freedom and make Britain look like Soviet Russia, or Stasi East Germany during the Cold War. Seeing as he was a spy for the Soviets, as recalled by Czech spy, Jan Sarkocy, who recruited Corbyn in the 1980s, he has a real affinity for the machinations of the Cold War era. He wants to introduce it into Britain with mass censorship and threats.” Pravda The Corbyn press model would be to nationalise all newspapers, where all editorial decisions would have to go through a central Soviet committee linked to the Labour party. This is already occurring with the BBC, who after a week of media reports of Corbyn’s spy past had been revealed, had still barely acknowledged the news, and refused to report on it so as to protect their leader and party chief. The BBC is the official voice of the Labour party and supports its soviet ideals with extreme passion. The offices of the Pravda newspaper were transferred to Moscow on March 3, 1918 when the Soviet capital was moved there. Pravda became an official publication, or “organ”, of the Soviet Communist Party. Pravda became the conduit for announcing official policy and policy changes and would remain so until 1991.

When the collapse comes, there will be complete disorder and chaos. Banks will shut, all social security will stop, and all emergency services will eventually be forced to stop after being inundated. Naturally, disorder and collapse of all financial services will result in rioting in the streets accompanied with mass looting of all businesses and rich people in their homes. No food and water for three days will make any population, however civilised beforehand, into wild savages. One must remember that disorder in the West, is a trigger for the West’s enemies to strike. Therefore, China, Iran, N.Korea and Russia would capitalise on the chaos. Striking while your enemy is at his weakest is a sure way for success in any military attack. The precept for invasion could also be cloaked in aiding the West, where they move troops in to keep order on the premise of helping whichever nation they are invading. South China Sea and All That This is why New Zealand, and Australia, which are only a ship ride away from China would be one of the first places to be attacked. China has had its eye on Australia for some time, and who is to say they won’t have an eye on New Zealand as well? Peter Thiel, and his billionaire friends would thus be rounded up just like everyone else and sent to re-education camps or communist Chinese gulags. Remember that the Chinese are desperate for land, and Australia/New Zealand have plenty for its needs. When it comes to swarm warfare, China wins hands down, nothing will get in their way, and the millions of fighting men and women of the Chinese military are a formidable force. The billionaires who are buying plots of land in New Zealand now can only be labelled as misinformed idiots with too much money and no sense. Are you that fucking stupid, blinded by your riches that you do cannot see the immediate threat lying directly above Australia? Idiots.

He is still an MP and leader of the Labour party and is sincerely hoping to seize revolutionary Bolshevik power soon. Old Jezza could take over the world and change it into some sort of communist collectivist allotment where everyone grows prize courgettes and marrows year in year out,” Cubby Broccoli’s niece, Jennifer Lettuce, told the Times. The plot change for the film has been quite time consuming for the writers but when opportunities like this arise, one has to seize the bull by the horns, or in Jeremy Corbyn’s words, the Czech spy by the cheque book. Jeremy Corbyn was allegedly paid a measly sum of £10,000 for the information he handed over to the soviets in the 1980s, but in the film, he will be demanding over a million quid. This money is then funnelled into a cultist secretive group called Momentum. “The secret to a good Bond film is always the villain. This is why Jeremy Corbyn will be ideal, because he has actually lived the life of a spy. Daniel Craig, who is meant to be James Bond hasn’t ever met a real spy before, and he is really chuffed about working with Jeremy,” the film’s director, Johnson Marx, told media outlets on Monday.'], ['5 Online Games that Are Easy to Grasp', 'Online gaming is becoming increasingly popular, particularly with people who are taking it up as a hobby.

People should not fund such a ridiculous racially divisive film which glorifies black supremacy and racism entertwined in impossible fantasy. In the isolationist fictional world of Wakanda; no immigration is allowed, the city has large walls around it, is a homogeneous ethno-state where only black people are allowed, and promotes black supremacy over all other races. Just reverse the colour and you get Trump’s vision of America. Amongst this utopian fantasy world lives black superheros with insane technology that can only be dreamed of, and is not close to reality in any way. Who designed this technological cornucopia of immense intricacy and superior advancement? The Wakanda crew can barely string a sentence together let alone create anti-gravity tech or nano suits which defy the laws of physics. The reality of Africa is that it is a continent of great resources but poor function. There is huge poverty in the continent and a film like this is a disgrace to Africans. It is essentially saying, if we were clever enough we could have the technology of the West within this fantasy but we don’t, the reality thus bites even more, and insults the African states of today who have very little technological advancement or technical knowhow. Apart from the brilliant Blade series, the only real black superhero seen on screen has to be ‘Ghost Dog’ with Forest Whitaker, who was not essentially a Marvel superhero but one of superhuman strength and intellect, thanks to diligent study of the Hagakure. Okay, Forest took the pay cheque for Black Panther, but we should not begrudge him on that. The director of Black Panther, Ryan Coogler, is obviously a black supremacist as can be seen in all his previous efforts, and his vision is one of complete domination of all by the black race. This is therefore not about equality, but supremacy, and where all other races are subjugated by the ‘superior’ black race. In essence, if this film were made of a race other than black, it would be panned as deeply racist, however because there is a special card for African Americans, it is instead lauded, and promoted as the next big thing since sliced bread. Double standards for African Americans, mixed in with hypocrisy and affirmative action. Don’t go and see this fantasy film that disregards everything about African reality, instead please give to the many aid charities in Africa who really need the help.

Certainly, here is a man who is a staunch Marxist who wants to come into power and create a Soviet dictatorship in the UK. “Mr Sarkocy, who was expelled from the UK by Margaret Thatcher and now lives in Bratislava, said that the information revealed by the MP – whose codename was Agent Cob – was “rated in Moscow as the number one”. Source: DT One can only imagine the amount of state secrets Comrade Corbyn handed over to the Soviets during the eighties, however one thing is sure, the people who are supporting Corbyn are supporting someone who is a danger to national interests and has allegedly caused great harm to the UK in the past by collaborating with its enemies. Should something be done about this? Well, of course, but it seems the sanitised MI6 are just sitting on their fingers, and everyone else is brushing it under the carpet. In the last elections, when Corbyn nearly came to power, Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, warned that “Mr Corbyn could not be trusted as prime minister and that, rather than be allowed to run the security services, he would previously have been investigated by them.” Is anyone going to act on the new information that has come to light? Surely, someone or some agency, or some entity must investigate further, and bring Corbyn to justice. Naturally, this news has not been reported by the BBC. You can’t have a former Soviet spy running the country, especially someone who sought to harm Britain by giving away information that put us in danger. Anyone out there?

The answers may surprise you. Here are a few of the craziest products and services you never would have believed you can buy with bitcoin. A college degree Colleges are beginning to realise the benefits of bitcoin and have thus begun to accept the currency as a valid payment method for tuition fees and more. The first university to accept bitcoin was Cyprus’ University of Nicosia. A number of other universities followed suit, including the University of Cumbria in the UK. A trip to Space Sir Richard Branson has a plan. The billionaire tycoon wants to start flying rich people into space on his Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo. Branson is a big fan of the virtual currency and believes that it only makes sense for what he referred to as “the pioneer of a global currency” to be used for the travel of the future. Celebrities who have secured a place on Branson’s trip include Ashton Kutcher, Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Bieber, and Lady Gaga. If you wanted to join them, it would set you back a princely 291.41 BTC. The world’s first Mac If you’re a fan of technology, you could own a piece of history in the form of the world’s first Apple Macintosh. It was released in 1984, and if you have around 6.34 BTC (at the time of writing) to spare, you can get your hands on this golden piece of tech nostalgia. Roulette games You can also spin the roulette wheel online by depositing a few bitcoins. It makes sense, as roulette remains one of the more popular casino games to play. When playing with the virtual currency, your gambling will remain anonymous. Further, there are reputable sites such as Gamble.io which recommends where to play, as well as advising on the best bitcoin roulette bonus from each casino. A goat or two Bitcoin isn’t simply about buying internet products or futuristic things. It’s now being accepted by regular real-world companies, as well. Cafes, restaurants, pubs, and even goat salespeople have begun allowing customers to pay by virtual currency. Bitcoin Goat has become something of an internet sensation – and isn’t doing the promotion of bitcoin any harm, either. A private island Bitcoin enthusiast and software developer Ryan Weaver intends to sell his private island, located off Pohnpei, to anyone who has the right amount of bitcoins. Weaver believes that he may be able to negotiate a deal once the price for bitcoin surges again. He hopes to sell the island for approximately 968 bitcoins. That’s not a bad deal when you consider that just seven short years ago, that would have bought you a measly couple of pizzas. Along with the above strange and curious ways to spend your bitcoin, you could also use the digital currency to buy a Canadian gold mine, spy coins, or mammoth tusks. Once you’ve turned your cash into bitcoin, you’re opening yourself up to a whole new world of weird.'], ['‘Fake News’ Created by Eric Schmidt Former Google Boss', 'Investigative journalist Sharyl Attkinson has revealed after extensive research into the Fake News purge on many sites across the internet, that Google’s former CEO, Eric Schmidt was the mastermind behind it all. His modus operandi was to smear any news site that held alternative views to the democrats, and Hillary Clinton during and after the 2016 election. Our site has suffered a lot from Google’s bias because satire was wrongly labelled as ‘fake news’, and we were numerously threatened by Google, to remove satirical material or face the consequences. We have also been demonetized and shadow banned on YouTube. Our site was also ejected from Google news feed during the fake news fiasco. “Digging deeper, she discovered that Google was one of the big donors behind First Draft’s “fake news” messaging. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, was run by Eric Schmidt, who happened to be a huge Hillary Clinton supporter. Schmidt “offered himself up as a campaign adviser and became a top multi-million donor to it. His company funded First Draft around the start of the election cycle,” Attkisson said. “Not surprisingly, Hillary was soon to jump aboard the anti-fake news train and her surrogate David Brock of Media Matters privately told donors he was the one who convinced Facebook to join the effort.” Attkisson declared that “the whole thing smacked of the roll-out of a propaganda campaign.” The Daily Squib surmised itself that the Fake News scheme was a way for the democrats to purge any form of alternative or conservative thought through censorship and labelling it as fake news. We never thought however that Google would be behind all of this, and are frankly disgusted, but not surprised. This whole sorry fake news debacle just shows the inherent power Google has over the internet and how it uses its power for the purposes of bias, corruption and censorship of large swathes of internet websites for its own ends. One thing about free speech is that every viewpoint should be heard, however much one disagrees with any viewpoint, it has a right to be heard. Censorship and bias thwarts the true tenets of democracy. By trying to artificially skew thought and literature, one dwells into the world of totalitarianism and dictatorship, essentially what Google has become. The only good thing about Google at the moment is Ray Kurzweil, who we are great fans of, and hope he is using his job to really move things forward in a positive way. Schmidt is now the head of an advisory board at the Pentagon, and is now teaching them the dark arts of manipulation, disinformation and propaganda for the internet age.'], ['Get to Know What Game You Can Enjoy Using Your Super Nintendo Emulator', 'For gamers that appreciate playing video games at home, Nintendo is the right video games producer.

The alleged ANTIFA member, adopted the communist, Marxist ideology utilised by the far left group which is supported by George Soros, Hillary Clinton, the Obamas, and other important American democrats. The killing spree started when Cruz set off the fire alarm so he could shoot more people funnelling through the corridors. As Cruz was a member of ANTIFA, and clearly supported their extreme left-wing communist ideology there are several motives for his actions. Firstly, ANTIFA is about disarming Americans, they are anti-gun, therefore what better way to bring up the anti-gun message again with another school massacre, secondly, he could have been targeting conservative students, especially Trump supporters, thirdly, he was angry at being expelled. We advocate for an ideology that has killed 94,000,000+ people in the 20th century and the media doesn’t bat an eye. Why? #Charlottesville pic.twitter.com/8XJAjOGBEx — Official Antifa (@OfficialAntifa) August 13, 2017 Of course, Cruz, like many of his communist brethren is brainwashed into the cause of revolution, this can only be done by violence. This is not just another American shooting spree, we are used to them now, but this was a politically motivated shooting. More to come.

Some MSM news services are now claiming that Cruz is in fact a far right wing Trump supporter who joined a supremacist paramilitary group that they conveniently do not name. This news is however hard to believe, especially when the Hispanic Cruz was registered to vote as a democrat. Hispanic democrat voters are not allowed in white supremacist groups. Naturally, there will be smoke and mirrors put out by certain agencies and factions, so it is hard to believe what is truth or not. One has to look at the facts, and if people suddenly appear out of nowhere claiming something, there must be questions asked, especially if the articles show very little evidence of what they are claiming, with no actual sources or names. FURTHER UPDATE MSM reports that Cruz was affiliated with white supremacist groups has been refuted by the Anti-Defamation League who backed away from their previous claims. Detectives are investigating a possible connect between Cruz and a small, Florida-based white supremacist group called the Republic of Florida, which seeks to create a “white ethnostate” in Florida. But the Anti-Defamation League, an organization that monitors hate groups, has backed away from its initial report that Cruz had been involved with that group. The league put out a statement saying that a representative of the group, who had earlier claimed Cruz was involved, now says he had been “misunderstood.” via Sun Sentinel'], ['Forbidden Delight: Censoring Words Makes Them More Powerful', 'Liberals and politically correct censors who censor linguistic language inadvertently make those censored words more powerful, more delicious, and liberating to use.

Many experts in the mechanics of eyesight and Ophthalmology have asked the painter to come in and get urgent help as she is in danger of not only hurting herself but others too. “I mean does this woman drive a car or operate heavy machinery? She is a danger to herself and others and must seek urgent medical assistance,” eye surgeon, Balthazar Medley M.D. appealed on Monday. According to the Obamas, the painter of the Michelle Obama portrait only got the role because of ‘affirmative action’. In the United States, even though some black people may not be qualified or able to do a job, they are still given the role not for their ability but for the colour of their skin. For many, this is seen as ‘positive discrimination’ and is not a justified way to run employment, however it is a valid American system and has been running for many years. The painter of the Michelle Obama portrait, Ambingo Shaquanda Fantasay, was adamant that the portrait she painted is what she saw: “I axe her, I said is that you Michelle, she say yeah?

With most charities only giving away 1% of their take to charity work, and the rest to massive lucrative salaries, plane flights, unlimited expense accounts, parties, taxis and alcohol, most sane people do not give money to charities, however, the world is not filled with sane people it seems and charities bring in millions every day. The Romans Speaking from one of her mansions, Ms Ortens revealed that the orgies will include anything that has ever been thought of or conceived in history. “The Romans liked their orgies, and we will certainly include as much from that era as today’s Tinderized Bachinalian sex riddled internet generation. As for things like AIDS and other STIs, well, like Tinder, we do not discriminate. If you want to go for it, why be a downer? Our orgies have a condition where everything is allowed — as long as you pay the price at the door, because you will certainly be paying the price when you walk out the door.” The Oxfam Orgies will start in Nassau, Bahamas in April, then much like a hurricane move through the Caribbean islands.

Even people who make a living by writing articles and journalists who write columns for the Wall Street Journal often admit that it is demanding. There are quite a few reasons why. It might be hard to write on a given topic. First of all, not every theme is to your liking. Sometimes you are assigned to write about something which is boring to death. Secondly, you have to be more or less competent about what you write. A prior research always helps to write a powerful and effective assignment.

Certainly, there is no secret to George Soros funding the most hated woman in Britain to stop Brexit. Can George Soros thwart Brexit? All the Remoaner MPs and other cohorts of money obsessed traitors are given the impetus to act against Brexit, especially when they are handed brown envelopes or suitcases full of money. The treachery of those in government who accept these payments to Remoan and thwart our democratic right to Brexit is something that is not only despicable but inherently immoral, and some would say illegal. In these times of treason, even if these money-grabbing cowards get caught in the media spotlight, as has happened with the established Daily Telegraph reporting, they will still get away with murder. The reason being, the underlying establishment who are Remainers are supporting them. How much wrong has to be committed on the people who voted for Brexit on June 23, 2016 until justice, and a bona fide exit from the EU is conducted? Leavers have been punished, denigrated and side-stepped for too long. Now is the time to fight back for democracy and to punish the crooks, scumbags and shit heads who are actively trying destroy our democratic right to leave the EU whilst getting paid huge sums of money by their masters. Fuck you Soros and fuck you Gina Miller, and all the other crooked Remoaners on the take.

The event was designed to give London audiences a chance to enjoy the work awarded at Epica’s ceremony in Berlin in November. At the well-attended event, creatives Giles Hepworth and Bill Hartley of J. Walter Thompson London were congratulated for their award-winning entry “Ashes to Art”, which led to the agency becoming Epica’s UK agency of the year. Campaign Campaign’s global editor-in-chief, Claire Beale, who joined the Epica jury for the first time last year, praised the work. But she also encouraged more British agencies to enter Epica in the future. “I saw so much inspiring work from other countries; I felt sort of humbled really. It was a fantastic opportunity to appreciate the breadth of work from around the world. But I also thought: ‘Come on the Brits, where are you on this?’” J. Walter Thompson’s campaign involved encouraging artists to turn ashes from a catastrophic fire at the Glasgow School of Art into original artwork. This was then auctioned off to help pay for the school’s restoration. Bill Hartley remarked that the hardest part of the campaign was convincing the artists themselves to take part. “In the end we resorted to good old-fashioned direct mail, sending them charred pieces of wood in the post.” Creative Review Regular Epica juror Eliza Williams, associate editor of Creative Review, remarked that the awards show had seen an increase in brand-purposed or charity work recently. She added: “The best thing for me is not only seeing the work, but getting the journalists’ impression of it…You get a perspective that perhaps you don’t get in any other setting.” Daily Squib First time attendee at the Epica soiree, Daily Squib editor, and champion of creativity, Aur Esenbel, was truly impressed by the show of advertising and media talent: “Meeting with Mark Tungate and other denizens of the advertising, publishing world was inspiring. “It has been a great honour to have been accepted as a juror for the creative Epica awards, and one has to say that the essence of all creative work lies in intricate controlled chaotic exploration. “Defining that singular moment in the creative process when out of the ether, the creative plucks out an idea, an essence, a cherished spark that is then catapulted further with experimentation and work, to eventually create the final polished output, is not easily described. “Everyday, the Daily Squib works its creative juices whether in literature or illustration, and we are dedicated to the field of Creative Science in constructing our satire and news stories. “In line with Claire Beale, from Campaign magazine, the Epica Awards definitely needs more British input. Hopefully in 2018, the awards will see a bigger Brit emphasis. “Once again, thank you to the Epica team, and sponsors for holding such an event, and for inviting the Daily Squib to participate, it has been a true honour.” Epica Awards Director – Mark Tungate Epica editorial director Mark Tungate extended a warm thanks to GCRS for hosting the evening for the second year running. He also thanked the other sponsors: Adobe, Euronews, Screen Vision and Global Production Network. Film CataCover, which provides weather insurance for shoots, sponsored the drinks. Tungate added: “The event was as good-humoured as last year’s. Networking and socialising around a reel of outstanding creative work is a great way of shrugging off the gloom of January.”'], ['EU Devil’s Maiden Anna Soubry Like Something From an Omen Movie', 'Anna Soubry protects the EU like the devil’s maiden, Mrs. Baylock protecting the Antichrist Damien in the Omen series of films. Such is her crazed EU obsessive look and her mad spiky hair that to see her walk down the halls of Westminster, many get out of her way so as not to catch that stare in her demonic EU maddened eyes. She lives for the EU, and she will certainly die for it too, her glazed over eyes pointing backwards, and the spittle foaming at her mouth. The devil’s maiden, Anna Soubry, has planted herself somehow into the Conservative party, and within it she wreaks havoc, constantly preaching about how great her satanic masters are in Brussels, and how leaving the curtain of evil in the EU will destroy Britain. Whenever there’s a parliamentary debate, Anna Soubry suddenly appears out of a hidden door, with a puff of smoke, this demonic feral creature and her furry raspy tongue spits out vitriol against anyone who values Britain’s freedom from the EU. She is against freedom, she is only for the EU and its heaving laws of certain imprisonment. So who is Anna Soubry? Borne from the puckered popping anus of a jackal in a cemetery somewhere in Lincolnshire, this priestess of the infernal was schooled in the dark arts from an early age, and was once a journalist and TV presenter for Grampian Television North. She somehow appeared in the Conservative party as a plant from her masters in Brussels and has to this day continued to undermine not only the Tories but the Brexit process at every turn. This evil, festering boil from the leaking asshole of Hades follows the cult of the EU with such fervour and brainwashed dedication that she has had the EU flags tattooed on her buttocks, as well as a hammer and sickle tattoo on her sagging swaying hag breasts. Nevertheless, no one knows how she got to Westminster? The only thing they know, as MPs and their staff mill around the hallways and offices, is that if she is heard coming, hide, jump, run, get away with you, do not look into her devil eyes, or you too could succumb to her satanic demonic ways as well and forever be damned to Hell.'], ['Why Burstcoin is the Answer to an Eco Friendly Cryptocurrency', 'B urstcoin is the future of cryptocurrency because it is ecologically green to mine, and is safe to use.

Stockbrokers are running around their offices scurrying like rats from a sinking ship! Investors are getting the fear..like serious fear. If Bitcoin can drop like a rock, why not legitimate stocks? Maybe this is revenge by the hackers and dark netters after their Bitcoin high was spiked by various governments. It only makes sense, if governments want to hurt Crypto, the hackers and users on the dark net will fight back. Shit flies when the shit storm hits, and fear rises faster than it takes a margin call to liquidate your positions. Sure, this could be a correction, hang in there, maybe even buy more, but what if it ain’t, you’ll be locked in as the stocks hit the floor, your once tidy profit now a worthless piece of shit. Can you seriously watch the whole market drop while holding? No, siree! Better to dump, keep what cash you have. There’s also the Democrats, obviously they are enjoying this every moment with avid appreciation at the destruction of the Teflon Don, but what if the Dems engineered this fall? Well, they’ll hurt their people as much as others, although the hierarchy will only see that as collateral damage, and a necessary evil. Who frickin’ knows what will happen now? The fall is contagious as much as fear is, and it spreads like wildfire, it speeds up, accelerates and burns every corner of the global financial markets.

The Dow dropping 1,600 points is a drop in the ocean though when the market falls 60% then there will be cause for concern. How can you tell where the bottom is? That’s a hard one, almost like trying to find the highest high, but the lowest low will be the place where buying interest starts again.

Ruled by an unelected core of technocrats, the EU Commission, they answer to no one, unlike a democracy where elected officials answer to an electorate. Ask any European to name one single person who rules over them in the EU Commission, and you will get a blank answer. The sad part about this is that the regular EU citizen is not phased by this, instead they go on living their simple lives without questioning anything. After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Soviet officials in the Eastern German communist government were integrated into the EU ruling hierarchy. Today we are seeing the fruits of their endeavours, with an EU so closely integrated that it is nigh on impossible for a nation to remove itself from the dictatorial structure. The UK may never leave the EU because of the various Marxist economic rules intertwined within its makeup. In the unlikely event that Britain does manage to escape this Eurocommunist construct, one can only pity the nations left behind, who will have the rest of their sovereignty eviscerated and integrated into ‘Ever Closer Union’. To see the proud Gaelic Irish race, who fought tooth and nail to gain freedom from rule for thousands of years, join the EU without even a whimper, not even a fight is sad beyond belief. These proud fighters have condemned their nation and people to be ruled as slaves by Brussels, where their every move is dictated, where their every law is ordered and where their every economic decision is instated without their say. To fight for thousands of years, then surrender your sovereignty without a single fight is a sign that there are defeated people amongst us, and the Irish are a lost race in the EU. Socialists, Marxists, and ill-informed actors, always cite Winston Churchill as wanting this communist sovietised EU construct, but they are wrong, Churchill hated communism, and to see a massive communist bloc emerge in Europe would have frightened his political sensibilities. His vision of a European future was to see an Anglo-Franco union, but this never happened. Instead, we now have a Germano-Franco union ruling over the subsidiary countries. The Soviet style that the EU has adopted is more of a Maoist modern Chinese communistic counterpart incorporating little utopian bits like the free-movement amongst all states Schengen Zone. EU communism can also be coined as the New Communism, or Eurocommunism. Economically speaking, the EU values capitalism, and yet is communist, much like China which embraces free market capitalism opposed to communist economics, yet is still a communist state. Mikhail Gorbachev once commented after the fall of the Berlin wall: “The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.” Current Russian leader, Vladimir Putin has said: “Above all, we should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century. As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and co-patriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself.” And from this disintegration of Old Soviet Russia came a New Soviet EUnion construct deep in the heart of Europe, called the European Union, and in the future, it will admit what it really is, ‘The Soviet European Union’. As for Russia, the plan probably highest in EU military circles, within the newly formed EU Army will be integration of Russia. From there, Putin and his cronies will have their old Soviet state back, that is if they survive the purges. Modern communism within the EU is softened down version much like China, where religion is tolerated relatively, and there is heavy use of censorship to limit alternative viewpoints to its socialist ideologies. In essence, the EU wants to spread as far as it can go. The planners deep in the EU Commission would like the EU to take over the world economically, much like they have conquered European nations, without a single shot being fired. What the EU is is the Fourth Reich backwards. Where Hitler began militarily to conquer Europe, the EU conquered Europe economically. Once this was completed, this is when it was safe to talk about creating an EU Army so as not create fear amongst its conquered subjects. The future of Europe is one that will be fraught with conflict thanks to the aspirations of the unelected leaders of the EU who will invariably coax Russia into skirmishes along the borders. It was EU meddling in the Ukraine that finally awoke the sleeping bear, and Putin decided enough was enough. There will be more of these incidents occurring, until the Russian bear is mobilised completely, and the EU leaders will have what they want, a full conventional ground war, and more of a reason for ever closer union.

The foundation’s secretary, Janice Anderson, was adamant that president Trump deserved the honour of being remembered on Mount Rushmore with all of America’s other great presidents forever. “President Donald Trump has brought America up again after many years of stagnation under that other guy. The economy is zooming ahead, manufacturing, exports, oil production, jobs, and low unemployment. The stock market just rises and rises beyond any levels we could have ever dreamed of, and the Democrats are dumbfounded, lost, and speechless. What Mr. Trump has done for the American people is beyond anything we have seen ever, and he’s got more, there’s more to come. The Teflon Don. What a guy? What a prez!” According to tradition, the Mount Rushmore Donald Trump statue would be completed a few years after he leaves office. “We have commissioned the finest sculptors from Italy to come here and complete the statue. It would take about one and a half years to complete. The sculptors have also compensated for the Don’s haircut, which would effectively make the statue 75 feet taller than the other statues, but we are sure that would be pleasing to the president. “Donald Trump’s head would go next to Abraham Lincoln’s, as there is a spot there ready for crafting. Altogether, the statue will cost the US taxpayer $42 million, that’s a drop in the ocean compared to what Donald Trump has brought to America economically.”'], ['Venice Trattoria Charges Jap Tourists 450,000 Euros For Fish Platter', 'Four Japanese tourists who ordered a fish platter consisting of one slice of trout, one slice of salmon and a few lettuce leaves, plus a round of cokes to drink were astounded to receive a bill from the Trattoria Mafiosi, in St Marks Square, for 450,000 euros. “Like all the dumb Japs, they paid up and left,” Luigi Montagna, the eatery’s laughing 5″1 owner told the local Venetian news. To say it is dangerous to eat in Venice if you are a foreigner is an understatement. The unscrupulous restaurant owners love to rip off tourists who they think don’t know better. “The tourist he say to me he want a lasagne. I slap on a teaspoon of mincemeat, half cook, then throw on a piece of lettuce over the top. He smile like it best Italian food in world. I charge him 670 euros not including tax. He leaves happy, I leave restaurant straight to my mistress, happy. We all happy, innit?” another Venetian restauranter revealed with jocularity. It takes fucking balls to charge someone that amount of money for a mediocre meal and get away with it. We asked an Italian psychologist what kind of person could get away with such behaviour? The balls of an Italian – Avercele “Balls! Avercele! Only an Italian can charge such large amounts. We have the biggest hairy balls in the world. As a man during the day, you have to touch your balls every few minutes, you know pat them, treat them nice. This is why Italian restaurants can charge obscene amounts of money to tourists and get away with it, like nothing happened. Balls. That’s what Pacino said in Scarface, the only thing that give orders is Balls. Women can’t do this shit, they don’t have the balls, and they don’t have Italian balls, the biggest fucking balls in the fucking world. That’s why we drive Ferraris and Lamborghini. That’s why we shoot for goal from halfway line, that’s why we can charge a Japanese tourist 750,000% over the normal asking price — Balls!” Professor of Psychology at Venice University, Gianluca Palle, revealed. The Venetian Tourist Board advised all visitors to Venice to be prepared to be ripped off at all restaurants as it is an “Italian customary right to inflict ridiculous prices on tourists”. In November 2017, a British tourist dubbed a Venice restaurant “horrible and disgusting” after being charged €25,526 (£22,420) for lunch for three. The tourist from Coventry ate with his parents at Trattoria Stronzo in the central San Marco district, ordering a spread of food and sharing it between them. Italian restaurants often charge by weight rather than portion, and the restaurant denied any wrongdoing. Venice mayor Luigi Coglione introduced fines last year of 2,000 euros to dissuade tourists from littering, walking around topless and other acts deemed inappropriate, but also said tourists “need to shell out a bit” when eating in the city, following criticisms of extortionate bills at restaurants.'], ['Anti-Art #metoo Puritans Order Removal of All Female Nude Paintings Worldwide From Galleries', 'Hylas and the Nymphs by John William Waterhouse, 1896 When it comes to the #metoo new puritanism that is sweeping the politically correct sovietized West, there is no place sacrosanct. Now that the art world and museums are being targeted worldwide by the cultureless puritans and their ISIS-like penchant for erasing history with destruction, new levels of censorship and banning are being reached daily. “I saw a Roman statue of a female nymph. The statue objectifies the female form and accentuates her breasts and privates. This is disgusting. We should ban everything Roman,” one social justice warrior yelled at the British museum’s Roman section. The woman was then pointed towards the Greek section of the museum where she went even more hysterical after spying a sculpture of a Greek Goddess fellating a male lion according to some myth or something. Of course the sculpture of a nude woman objectifies the female form, that is what art is meant to do, it is meant to present this piece of stone, then transform it into this wonderful curvaceous objectification of the beautiful female form. It is in essence a celebration of the female. What the fuck is wrong with that? Sculptures and painters have been doing it for thousands of years. Celebration of Fertility Gustave Courbet’s 1866 painting “The Origin of the World” The vagina and vulva have been depicted in art from prehistory to the contemporary art era of the 21st century. Visual art forms representing the female genitals encompass two-dimensional (e.g. paintings) and three-dimensional (e.g. statuettes). As long ago as 35,000 years ago, people sculpted Venus figurines that exaggerated the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva. Feminist activist Gina Warte, has applauded an obscure Manchester art gallery — which will either hopefully be burned to the ground or attendance dropped to zero — that recently threw out a Waterhouse painting depicting some salacious nymphs coaxing a man into a pond. This pre-Raphaelite masterpiece has now been consigned to the bin thanks to the feminazi puritans. “This Waterhouse painting showed a vile depiction of young women as objects in a pond asking a man to join them. In 2018 wimmin hate men and we would never ask a man to join us in the water only if we could drown the bastard. I myself have never slept with a man or had relations with a man because I have big arms, a hairy chest and my vulva looks like a pair of testicles dangling between my legs. I am therefore angry at men for rejecting me.” All galleries worldwide were warned in a global poster campaign funded by shady socialist groups that they have until next week to remove all depictions of women from all galleries, especially if nude. John D. Salinger, a gallery owner from New York was not amused by the anti-art, anti-female form puritanical activism that has been going around. “Puritans have a choice. They can stay away from the art gallery, they can switch off, they can hide in their room, but for fuck’s sake, let us other people enjoy what we’ve been enjoying for thousands of years, i.e. the female nude body. Just go and shoot yourself in your brainwashed nazi brain.”'], ['Women at the Oscars – A History of Academy Snubs', 'W omen in film have not only had a hard time on the so-called ‘casting couch’ throughout history, but at the celebration of film, the yearly Oscars ceremonies where sadly women have suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, by being trumped on the podium by male actors/producers/directors. Betway Insider has analysed the dire situation for women at the Academy Awards. Out of 442 Oscar ceremonies, only five women have ever been nominated for Best Director. This massive discrepancy can also be followed by the statistic that out of the five nominations, only one woman has ever won an Oscar for directing, and that’s Kathryn Bigelow – ‘Hurt Locker’ at the 82nd Academy Awards in 2010. Greta Gerwig, was nominated for ‘Lady Bird’ at the 2017 Academy Awards, the first since Kathryn Bigelow in 2010. The other female directors nominated for Best Director were: Lina Wertmuller, ‘Seven Beauties’ (1977), Jane Campion, ‘The Piano’ (1994) and Sofia Coppola, ‘Lost in Translation’ (2004). In an industry dominated by men, the film industry has to change its inherent bias, and address the multitude of female talent whether in acting or direction. Who would ever think that a film celebrating woman power like ‘Wonder Woman’ and actress Gal Gadot was completely snubbed at the 2017 Academy Awards? This says it all. As for screenwriting, only 14 out of a possible 162 winners have been women at the Academy Awards. It was not until the 64th Academy Awards in 1992 that a solo female screenwriter was honoured with an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and that was ‘Thelma and Louise’ writer, Callie Khouri. Three female screenwriters have won the award since then: Jane Campion, ‘The Piano’ (1994), Sofia Coppola, ‘Lost in Translation’ (2004) and Diablo Cody, ‘Juno’ (2008). Betway Insider Outlining the other categories at the Academy Awards, a woman has never won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, or even been nominated for the award until 2017 when Rachel Morrison was nominated for ‘Mudbound’. The only category that has produced the most female winners is Best Costume Design, with 58 of the possible 86 awards going to women. So why is this happening? Women have as much talent behind and in front of the screen as men. Should women not be treated equally in Hollywood with regards to their capacity for talent in important film roles? Well, the reasons for this bias can only be found in the fact the Academy is a male-dominated industry. As of 2018, 72 percent of Oscar voters are men. Only two women have ever hosted the Oscars solo: Whoopi Goldberg and Ellen DeGeneres, who have done so six times between them (1994, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2007 and 2014). In comparison, a man has hosted the ceremony on his own 56 times. Will Hollywood, and the Academy Awards ever address this massive bias towards women, or will it always brush this subject under the red carpet as it always seems to do? Now is the time, in the millenium, to finally bring forth women in the industry’s important roles, and to say goodbye to the old days, and old way of thinking.'], ['Man is PARALYSED from the Waist Down Following Nonstop 20-Hours Reading Daily Squib Binge', 'A s paramedics carried the Daily Squib fan to the hospital on a stretcher, he begged his friends to keep on reading satirical articles for him, according to a report on Chinese media.

There is no hope in the Conservative party, and their stance on Brexit is the defining moment when the people who championed the Tories once should punish them dearly by voting and supporting Jeremy Corbyn to come to power and his high tax, unholy crusade to punish the rich, to punish the royals, and to punish the landed classes with his antithesis to capitalism, and his Soviet Marxist ideals of collectivisation. Yes, the country would fall even further into debt, and multiple generations of Britons would be saddled with paying that off, but the Tories squandered their chance, especially with the unelection of Theresa May as PM. It is too late, it is too far gone to say anything else other than let us unite behind the communist shisters in Momentum and their champagne socialist Islington affairs resplendent with the horrendous Marxist agenda brought upon by Comrade Corbyn. Let us support the grey bearded, red socked, sandalled one who shall step over the hallowed doorstep of Number 10, Downing Street, and defile the very corridors, and rooms that Margaret Thatcher once resided. The blood, crimson, bubbling with ardour and oozing from the blue stained Tories is one that has come to be poured into a bucket, and tipped gently over the head of Theresa May. She had her chance, she squandered it. Now, she and the country will be punished forever by a Corbyn win — a pure hell that will envelope the nation like a dark tumultuous curtain of death. Not only will Labour condemn the nation to hell economically, but it will also turn around any EU Brexit wins, of which there are none, and soon we will all be embroiled in a euro currency, and forever servitude to the dastardly EU. No one had the balls to stand up to Theresa May. Not one single Tory stood up. Not one. This is why Jeremy Corbyn should be the correct punishment for the Tory apathy, and silence. And as Edmund Burke once said: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men should do nothing.”'], ['The Watered Down Death of Brexit Means the Death of Democracy in Britain', 'Theresa May and her Remainer Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, and all the other Remainers who are in charge of the watered down Brexit are a key factor in Britain’s democracy dying a death so horrible that to look upon the UK as a democratic country with its own sovereign laws ever again will be met only with sickening laughter. Such is the watering down process by the insipid May, who has capitulated to every EU demand without even a word, that her contempt for the British people and their wishes is all too evident. How Britain has fallen from once a proud nation, sailing the high seas, conquering new lands, trading worldwide, exporting their wares, and importing other products. The death of Brexit ultimately means the death of democracy, from whence the vultures and crooked scum traitors sold off their country for a pittance and aided our enemies against the Crown. The people of Britain are thus deemed worthless, they are mere chattel to be thrown from one place to another without say, democracy, a long forgotten memory amongst the dead eyed treasonous traitors who take backhanders from Brussels and defend their immoral ill gotten gains by backstabbing the voter. Contempt for democracy, contempt for law, contempt for the will of the people, and contempt for Britain’s honour, only shame remains, shame and cowardice. The crooked have won, as Tony Blair laughs into the faces of the British people, he gains more riches off their misery, and he laughs even more, the delight of getting away with treason, getting away with all that he has done, the blood soaked membranes of dead Iraqi children moulded into each and every mansion he owns with his evil witch wife. Theresa May is a cowardly grey mutt, a withering faltering non-entity who has succumbed to the EU, she has sold the British nation to the dogs, condemned us to many more years of transitionary purgatory, just as her barren womb aches for a child, she herself aches for redemption from the people who she has so callously betrayed. A stinking rotten womb black with injustice to the British people, Theresa May is a malevolent tawdry puss filled pustule that will one day burst onto her gilded mirror, a gooey reminder of what she really is, and how she cannot sleep at night any more. None of them who betrayed Britain should ever be allowed to forget their crimes of treason, their abandonment of democracy and their treacherous selling of Britain to our enemies and their corpulent envelopes filled with dirty euros handed to them under tables, in dark alleys, and EU offices. Betrayal of the fundamental tenets of democracy is what they have done by watering down Brexit. If one cannot hold a democratic referendum and have the result stick, what hope is there for democracy? We all know that the EU, a body of unelected officials does not value democracy, BUT BRITAIN SHOULD VALUE DEMOCRACY! You cannot have a referendum and then say it was not the right answer you wanted then have another one, then another one until you get the correct answer according to your nefarious agenda? That IS NOT DEMOCRACY! The people were assured that the result of the EU Referendum, held on June 23, 2016, would stand. This result was agreed to be respected by all parties, but they did not, and this is why we are here now in the year 2018, with a watered down Brexit in name only. We have had enough of Theresa May. She has delayed, allowed Remainers to dictate what happens, and she has agreed to all EU terms without question. Theresa May is inoperative. There is no other way than to oust this fucking turkey, and put her in the oven. Get some fucking balls someone and get up, oust Theresa May right now. Decisions can be made in less than thirty seconds, do not think, ACT. You must do this right now, to save Britain from an un-democratic future under the EU. This is a fight for Western Democratic rights, it is a fight for our right to make our own laws, our own sovereign national state, it is a fight for the basic tenets of δημοκρατία dēmokratía, or “rule of the people” NOT by unelected faceless Eurocrat officials from the European Commission. NO!'], ['Up Yours Juncker/Delors No! No! No!', 'hansard.parliament.uk Somewhere under here is the answer to the problems we are dealing with today. Can you spot the elusive solution? The Prime Minister (Mrs. Margaret Thatcher) With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement on the European Council held in Rome on 27 and 28 October, which I attended with my right hon. Friend Douglas Hurd the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. The conclusions of the Council have been placed in the Library of the House. The Council had to deal in the first place with some urgent items of current business: namely, the Community’s failure to agree a negotiating position on agriculture for the Uruguay round of trade negotiations; the situation in the Gulf, and the position of the foreign nationals held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait; and the problems which have arisen in Hungary. Looking further ahead, the Council also dealt with the preparations for the two intergovernmental conferences, on economic and monetary union and also on institutional reform, which are due to begin in December. I shall report on the Council’s business in that order. The Uruguay round of trade negotiations is due to be completed before the end of this year. The outcome will decide whether world trade becomes steadily more open, or we repeat the mistakes of the past and relapse into protectionism. The most difficult item is agriculture. All the major participants in the Uruguay round committed themselves to table negotiating offers by 15 October. All except the European Community have done so. The Community has been discussing this problem since the round began in the autumn of 1986. It gave an unequivocal commitment in April last year to make substantial and progressive reductions in agricultural support. That commitment was repeated at the Houston economic summit in July this year. The Commission has put forward a proposal for 30 per cent. reductions, backdated to 1986. So what has already been done by way of reduction of support since then will be set against that 30 per cent. There have been six sessions of European Community Ministers to discuss the proposal. The most recent, lasting some 16 hours, was on Friday last week. But no agreement has been reached. The main opposition has come from France and Germany. The Community’s failure has harmed its reputation. Negotiations between the leading groups of countries cannot start until the Community’s proposals have been tabled. The European Council requested Ministers to meet again and put the Commission in a position to table a negotiating offer. The Netherlands Prime Minister suggested that the basis for this should be the position reached when Agriculture Ministers suspended their work early on 27 October. But President Mitterrand made it clear that France would continue to vote against those proposals. It remains for Agriculture and Trade Ministers to try yet again to reach a conclusion. If we fail, it will give a signal to the world that the Community is protectionist. Next, with regard to the Gulf and the position of the hostages, the European Council agreed a firm statement calling for Iraq’s withdrawal from Kuwait and confirming Europe’s absolute commitment to full implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The [column 870]statement makes it clear that we shall consider further steps if Iraq does not comply. The message is that Saddam Hussein must not gain anything from his aggression. The Council also strongly condemned Iraq for holding foreign nationals as hostages and for using them in an unscrupulous way. This is totally unacceptable. Moreover, Iraq is negotiating over the hostages with the purpose of trying to divide the international community. After considerable discussion, the Council affirmed our determination not to send representatives of our Governments in any capacity to negotiate with Iraq for the release of hostages, and to discourage others from doing so. I believe that the unity of the Twelve, and our determination not to allow Saddam Hussein to divide us on the question of hostages, will send a very powerful signal to Iraq. The third point is assistance to Hungary. In the course of the Council, member states received appeals from the Government of Hungary for help in dealing with the serious problems that have arisen as a result of the reduction in the supply of oil from the Soviet Union. The consequent price rises have given rise to unrest. The Council issued a strong statement of support for Hungary in pursuing its path towards democratic and economic reforms and the rule of law. The Council also agreed, at the United Kingdom’s suggestion, to bring forward and disburse rapidly the second instalment of the $1 billion Community loan for Hungary which we agreed last year. This will be of direct practical assistance. Those were the urgent matters on which the Council had to act. Looking further to the future, we also discussed the preparations for the two intergovernmental conferences, or IGCs, which will start their work on 14 December. For the conference on political union, the Council had before it a report by Foreign Ministers listing a wide range of possible institutional changes which the intergovernmental conference might consider. Heads of Government called for further work to be done on these proposals between now and December. My right hon. Friend Douglas Hurdthe Foreign Secretary and I argued that it would be wrong to prejudge the conclusions of the intergovernmental conference. We were on strong ground, since the Community’s original decision to call the conference specified that it should set its own agenda. Nevertheless, others wished to give specific directions to the IGC. We therefore reserved the United Kingdom’s position on, for example, extension of the Community’s powers into new areas, greater powers for the European Parliament in the legislative sphere, defining European citizenship, and a common foreign and security policy. All these are issues for discussion at the intergovernmental conference itself rather than to be settled in advance. On economic and monetary union, I stressed that we would be ready to move beyond the present position to the creation of a European monetary fund and a common Community currency which we have called a hard ecu. But we would not be prepared to agree to set a date for starting the next stage of economic and monetary union before there is any agreement on what that stage should comprise. And I again emphasised that we would not be prepared to have a single currency imposed upon us, nor to surrender the use of the pound sterling as our currency. The hard ecu would be a parallel currency, not a single currency. If, as time went by, people and Governments chose to use it widely, it could evolve towards a single [column 871]currency. But our national currency would remain unless a decision to abolish it were freely taken by future generations of Parliament and people. A single currency is not the policy of this Government. I should like to offer four comments in conclusion. First, the Community finds it more difficult to take the urgent, detailed decisions than to discuss longer-term concepts. Moreover, no one should underestimate the extent to which national interests prevail among those who most proclaim their Community credentials. Secondly, Britain intends to be part of the further political, economic and monetary development of the European Community. That is what the great majority of member states want, too. When we come to negotiate on particular points, rather than concepts or generalities, I believe that solutions will be found which will enable the Community to go forward as Twelve. That will be our objective. Thirdly, we are fighting in Europe for British farmers, for British consumers, for a new world trade agreement, for help to the newly democratic countries of eastern Europe, and for the interests and concerns of our people. Fourthly, while we fully accept our commitments under the treaties and wish to co-operate more closely with other countries in the European Community, we are determined to retain our fundamental ability to govern ourselves through Parliament. I believe that that is the wish of this House, and we on this side will do our best to see that it is fulfilled. Mr. Neil Kinnock (Islwyn) I thank the right hon. Lady for that statement and welcome the summit statements on, first, the complete solidarity of the Governments of the Community countries against Saddam Hussein and, secondly, economic support for the Soviet Union, Hungary and other central and east European countries. On the central matter discussed in Rome, is it not clear that last weekend the Prime Minister managed to unite the rest of the European Community against her, to divide her own party and, more importantly, further to weaken the influence that Britain needs in order properly to uphold our national interests in the European Community? Can the Prime Minister tell us why she was apparently taken by surprise by the proposals put by others in Rome? Does she not recall that in 1985 she whipped and guillotined the Single European Act through the House, in June 1989 at Madrid she formally agreed with other heads of Government to be determined to achieve the progressive realisation of economic and monetary union, and at the Dublin summit this year she agreed to intensify the process of European union in economic, monetary and political terms? Those were all steps which raised comment at the time. Did she not know what she was doing on those occasions, or was she living in cloud cuckoo land? The Prime Minister says that the Government would not surrender the use of the pound sterling as our currency. Perhaps she will therefore tell us how she regards the advice of her fellow Conservative, Commissioner Brittan, when he said: “YOU DON’T HAVE TO LOSE THE POUND STERLING UNDER THE SINGLE CURRENCY PLAN. YOU CAN PERFECTLY WELL HAVE A NOTE OR A COIN WHICH STATES ITS VALUE IN POUNDS … AND ITS FIXED EQUIVALENT IN ECU … IT’S BEEN AGREED THAT THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE.” On the connection between currency and sovereignty, can the Prime Minister, who abandoned her own Madrid conditions before she put sterling into the exchange rate mechanism, tell the House what will be her conditions now [column 872]for putting sterling into the narrow banding of the ERM? The Prime Minister could come to a debate and explain all these things from the Dispatch Box if she was willing to do so. When the Prime Minister conducts herself as she did in Rome this weekend, is it any wonder that she cannot even get agreement for the necessary reduction in farm subsidies? [Interruption.] She has no influence at all. When she conducts herself as she does, is it any wonder that some members of her own party believe that she has undermined the Chancellor’s efforts to build support for the so-called hard ecu? Does she not realise that such an attitude makes the Heads of other Governments even less susceptible to listening to the sensible arguments that can be deployed in favour of sovereignty in the Community? Does she accept that it is reasonable to put the view that the determinants of the pace and direction of economic and monetary union should be the realities of economic performance and the degree of economic convergence, not arbitrary diary dates? Does the Prime Minister not understand that, with her method of conducting affairs, she is throwing away that sound argument and losing both potential allies and necessary influence? Does she not appreciate that, even now, her tantrum tactics will not stop the process of change or change anything in the process of change? All they do is strand Britain in a European second division without the influence over change that we need, the financial and industrial opportunities that we need and the sovereignty that we need. The Prime Minister It is our purpose to retain the power and influence of this House, rather than denude it of many of its powers. I wonder what the right hon. Gentleman’s policy is, in view of some of the things that he said. Would he have agreed to a commitment to extend the Community’s powers to other supplementary sectors of economic integration without having any definition of what they are? One would have thought, from what he said, that he would. The Commission wants to extend its powers and competence into health matters, but we said no, we would not agree to that. From what the right hon. Gentleman said, it sounded as though he would agree, for the sake of agreeing, and for being Little Sir Echo, and saying, “Me, too.” Would the right hon. Gentleman have agreed to extending qualified majority voting within the Council, to delegating implementing powers to the Commission, to a common security policy, all without any attempt to define or limit them? The answer is yes. He does not have a clue about the definition of some of the things that he is saying, let alone securing a definition of others. We have agreed to wait to give support to the Soviet Union until the IMF report is received. That is coming at the next summit. It was not we who stopped unity on agriculture—it was France and Germany. Had the right hon. Gentleman even read the statement, which he had before I came in, he would have noticed—and had he even listened to the statement when I made it, he would have known—that it was Francois Mitterrand who said that he would not agree to the Commission’s proposal. We are not to blame in any way for not reaching agreement on agriculture. But for the insistence of my right hon. Friend Douglas Hurdthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and me, the chair would not even have had the matter discussed, so urgent was it that [column 873]it should be. I told the chair over a week ago that, if the farm Ministers did not reach agreement, we must discuss the matter, and I wrote to him. He did everything that he could to see that a matter so urgent was not discussed, but we succeeded in getting it discussed. As to the right hon. Gentleman’s strictures about economic and monetary union, that phrase was agreed by the European Community before we went in. It is one of those things that we inherited. It was agreed in 1972. When it came to defining it—[Interruption.] We went into the Community in 1973, and I had understood that most Labour Members were in favour of that. I wonder today if they are changing their stance for the sake of debating points. Leon Brittan is a loyal member of the Commission. Yes, the Commission wants to increase its powers. Yes, it is a non-elected body and I do not want the Commission to increase its powers at the expense of the House, so of course we differ. The President of the Commission, Mr. Delors, said at a press conference the other day that he wanted the European Parliament to be the democratic body of the Community, he wanted the Commission to be the Executive and he wanted the Council of Ministers to be the Senate. No. No. No. Perhaps the Labour party would give all those things up easily. Perhaps it would agree to a single currency and abolition of the pound sterling. Perhaps, being totally incompetent in monetary matters, it would be only too delighted to hand over full responsibility to a central bank, as it did to the IMF. The fact is that the Labour party has no competence on money and no competence on the economy—so, yes, the right hon. Gentleman would be glad to hand it all over. What is the point of trying to get elected to Parliament only to hand over sterling and the powers of this House to Europe? Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will understand his brief a little better next time. Mr. Nicholas Ridley (Cirencester and Tewkesbury) rose—— Hon. Members Speak for Germany. Mr. Speaker Order. Mr. Ridley Mr. Ridley May I congratulate my right hon. Friend on standing up for the interests of the people of this country and ask her whether she thinks that the eleven are not now both isolated and intransigent in relation to agricultural policy and the GATT round? Does she think that they are deliberately working for the failure of the GATT round in order to achieve their objectives of a fortress Europe? If they are, does she agree that that is not a destination for which we want to board the train? The Prime Minister My right hon. Friend is right. The European community is the only group of nations which, after years of studying the problem, has not tabled an initial negotiating position on agriculture in the GATT round. The United States, Japan, the Cairns group, Canada and Switzerland have tabled theirs, but from the Community—nothing. It really is a disgrace that we have not even been able to agree on a negotiating position, let alone start to negotiate with all the other groups by between now and the end of the year. [column 874] Yes, I agree with my right hon. Friend that several countries in the Community are highly protectionist. The common agricultural policy is a protectionist policy, but we will try to reduce the protectionism, first because it would help the third world, secondly because it would mean that we would not have export subsidies—and thereby take business away from other countries—and thirdly because in this country we believe in open trade. This was the most serious matter to be discussed at the European Council, and I most earnestly hope that this time Agriculture Ministers—there will be no difficulty with us, but I mean the French and German Agriculture Ministers—will accept the proposals of the Commission for the negotiating position in the Uruguay round. Mr. Paddy Ashdown (Yeovil) Does the Prime Minister realise how welcome it was to hear in her statement that she has at last been forced to admit that the hard ecu proposal can be a transitional mechanism to a single currency? Will she congratulate the Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary on levering her forward towards reality on that matter? Does she realise that that is good news for Britain? Does the right hon. Lady realise how much of her performance at Rome was bad news for Britain? Does she realise that in a single meeting she has isolated this country in Europe, weakened our voice in Europe, divided the Government and betrayed this country’s long-term best interests? Does she realise that if she faced a Labour party that was not equally divided, muddled and confused on this matter, she would today face a motion of no confidence in her failure at this historic moment? Does she realise—[Interruption.] Mr. Speaker Order. Mr. Ashdown Does the Prime Minister realise that for as long as she hangs on to power, so long will Britain be held back from its future, and that she no longer speaks for Britain—she speaks for the past? The Prime Minister Oh dear, it seems that there must be quite a lot of late parrots in cloud cuckoo land, judging by the right hon. Gentleman coming out with that stuff. Of course, if there is a parallel currency and people choose to make more and more use of it, it could evolve into a single currency, but that could not be done without a decision coming back to this House and, I believe, to the people of this country. I take it that the right hon. Gentleman’s policy is to abolish the pound sterling, the greatest expression of sovereignty. In any event, it would be totally and utterly wrong to agree to that now. That matter is one to be decided by future generations and future Parliaments. Parliament is supreme, not the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Liberal Democrats. Mr. Robin Squire (Hornchurch) In the light of last weekend’s discussions, will my right hon. Friend reconsider in the near future the proposal to separate the Bank of England and make it independent so that it may serve as a buttress in this country’s battle against inflation? The Prime Minister Independent banks are mostly either answerable to a parliament—as in the United States, where Mr. Greenspan is answerable to Congress—or have a number of politicians on their boards. I do not believe that the structure that this country currently has would be [column 875]served well by the proposal that my hon. Friend mentions. It is far better to increase democracy than to reduce it, which I believe would be wrong at this time. Mr. James Lamond (Oldham, Central and Royton) What is the point of the Prime Minister trying to wrap herself in the union jack for electoral purposes—[Hon Members: “Better that than the red flag.” ]—and then coming to the Dispatch Box to tell the House that she is prepared to sell the working people of this country down the river by opening Britain up completely to free trade without any protectionism whatsoever, destroy the multi-fibre arrangement, and give the emerging democracies in Europe £1,000 million in loans to produce goods on wages of £80 a month, so that textiles in particular will flood into this country, which would destroy hundreds of thousands of British jobs? Is that what the right hon. Lady was elected to do? Is she really protecting this country, or is she only pretending to do so? The Prime Minister The hon. Gentleman probably heard the comment made by some of my right hon. and hon. Friends, “Better to wrap yourself in the union jack than the red flag.” The hon. Gentleman’s remarks amount to a totally protectionist policy, which would lead to retaliation against us, reduce the capability of our export industries and therefore our standard of living, and make our industries inefficient and therefore cost the housewife a great deal more. I note also that the hon. Gentleman complains about goods entering Britain from Third world countries where wages are far lower. I have heard the hon. Gentleman say several times in the House that Third world countries need help. They need trade as much as they need aid. Mr. Norman Tebbit (Chingford) Does my right hon. Friend agree that the mark of a single currency is not only that all other currencies must be extinguished but that the capacity of other institutions to issue currencies must also be extinguished? In the case of the United Kingdom, that would involve Parliament binding its successors in a way that it has hitherto regarded as unconstitutional. The Prime Minister I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. This Government have no intention of abolishing the pound sterling. If the hard ecu were to evolve and much greater use were to be made of it, that would be a decision for future Parliaments and generations. That decision could be taken only once. It should not be taken in the current atmosphere, but only after the greatest possible consideration. I believe that both Parliament and sterling have served this country and the rest of the world very well. We are more stable and influential with sterling, and it is an expression of our sovereignty. This Government believe in the pound sterling. Mr. James Molyneaux (Lagan Valley) Does the Prime Minister recall that Britain was in a minority of one in the Europe of 1940? Does she further agree that, 50 years on, the basic issue is still the same—undiluted parliamentary democracy and not imposed diktat? The Prime Minister I totally agree with the right hon. Gentleman. There are some things for which there was majority voting within the Community when we went in, and we accepted that, and for the specific objective of achieving the Single European Act only, there have been [column 876]more matters. Now there is an attempt to get far more things passed by majority voting. That means that we would have more laws imposed upon us, even if the House was flatly against them. We expect our people to obey the law, mainly because it has gone through all the legislative processes in this House, and we should be very slow to add to any majority competence on the part of the Community. Mr. Steve Norris (Epping Forest) Does my right hon. Friend accept that there is wide support in my constituency for the stance that she took at the intergovernmental conference on economic and monetary union? Does she further accept that that support is based not on the niceties of international economics but on the clear and firm belief that those who dictate fiscal policy to the United Kingdom should be fully and directly answerable to its electors? The Prime Minister I totally agree with my hon. Friend. The Delors report is proposing that those people should be answerable to no one. It is very ironic indeed that, at a time when eastern Europe is striving for greater democracy, the Commission should be striving to extinguish democracy and to put more and more power into its own hands, or into the hands of non-elected bodies. Ms. Joyce Quin (Gateshead, East) Is it not true that the British Government are far more reluctant than Germany, France or Italy to give economic assistance to the Soviet Union? Is the Prime Minister not aware of the political risks within the Soviet Union if we do not respond generously at this time, and of the long-term risks for British industry if other countries step in and establish aid and trading relationships with the Soviet Union before we do? The Prime Minister The German banks—the Deutsche bank—made a considerable loan to the Soviet Union of some DM6 billion. That had all gone within a matter of weeks. It was guaranteed by the Government of the Federal Republic, and it was all gone in a matter of weeks—used to repay debts which the Soviet Union owed to German manufacturers. That has done nothing to help the economic situation in the Soviet Union. When we got the request for help, we suggested that we should not consider general loans which would not help a country that was already in difficulties, but should see if we could give specific help in certain spheres—for example food processing, transport and oil exploration. We are studying that, and the International Monetary Fund is judging what it is necessary for the Soviet economy to do to get it out of its present difficulties. Fortunately, between the Houston economic summit and now, the Soviet Union has had a windfall in the sense that the increasing price of oil has given it a much better balance of payments position on a much greater scale than here, so that has improved its position. We shall make up our minds when the IMF has reported. Mr. Cranley Onslow (Woking) If these partners of ours—France and Germany—persist in blocking the reform of the common agricultural policy in December, what useful purpose does my right hon. Friend think that the intergovernmental conference is likely to achieve? The Prime Minister My right hon. Friend puts his finger on it absolutely. Agriculture and trade are two [column 877]subjects in which, as national countries, we have no competence at all as it is all negotiated through the Community. They can therefore do that—they can even do it in the Agriculture Council—by majority voting. If France and Germany stick together and refuse to have reductions in their subsidies, many of the other countries where farmers are far poorer than those in France and Germany will say, “How in the world can we agree to lower subsidies when the Community’s two sets of richest farmers will not do so?” I hope that the compromise solution that the Commission hammered out with Agriculture Ministers will nevertheless go through, but that is only the start, not the end, of the negotiating position with other countries; otherwise, we shall be responsible for reducing world trade. Dr. David Owen (Plymouth, Devonport) Is it not perfectly clear that what was being attempted at Rome was a bounce which led only one way—to a single federal united states of Europe? Is it not vital that, in this House and across party lines, it should be possible for a Prime Minister to make it clear, if necessary, that Britain is prepared to stand alone? We should not relish it, but if we were faced with the imposition by treaty of a single currency and with a situation that prevented the enlargement of the Community to include Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, would not Britain be entitled and right to use the veto? The Prime Minister I totally agree with the right hon. Gentleman. That is precisely the stance that we took. It is the stance that we have taken on many previous occasions. The European monetary system to which we belong is designed for 12 sovereign states, in co-operation with one another, to come to an exchange rate mechanism. What is being proposed now—economic and monetary union—is the back door to a federal Europe, which we totally and utterly reject. We prefer greater economic and monetary co-operation, which can be achieved by keeping our sovereignty. Mr. Hugh Dykes (Harrow, East) Does my right hon. Friend agree and confirm that her words today mean in effect that she would prefer to withdraw from the treaty of Rome and the Single European Act? The Prime Minister No. We should like to have the kind of Europe that we believe in and the Europe that we went in to join. If my hon. Friend looks back at some of the speeches, he will see that we were absolutely assured that we should not be giving up sovereignty. That was the basis upon which we went in. On 24 May 1971 Edward Heaththe Prime Minister said: “WE AGREED IN PARTICULAR THAT THE IDENTITY OF NATIONAL STATES SHOULD BE MAINTAINED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE DEVELOPING COMMUNITY. THIS MEANS, OF COURSE, THAT, THOUGH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS MADE AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE FORUM IN WHICH IMPORTANT DECISIONS ARE TAKEN, … IT PROVIDES A CLEAR ASSURANCE, … THAT JOINING THE COMMUNITY DOES NOT ENTAIL A LOSS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY OR AN EROSION OF ESSENTIAL NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY.” —[OFFICIAL REPORT, 24 MAY 1971; VOL. 818, C. 32–33.] Mr. Nigel Spearing (Newham, South) Despite what the Prime Minister has just said, is it not clear that it is the [column 878]wish of our partners that there should be a loss of national identity on currency? Is it not true that even the hard ecu, coupled with fixed exchange rates, would lead inexorably to economic and monetary union and to government either of bankers for bankers by bankers or to a strong political central government that would usher in a new Euro-state? If the Prime Minister is to save Britain as a self-governing nation, had she not better make that clear and galvanise the people of this country and all parties in Parliament to say a very polite no to economic and monetary union? The Prime Minister If I believed that, I would do just as the hon. Gentleman says, but I do not believe that his interpretation is correct. I accept that many in the Economic Community would like to have their version of economic and monetary union, which would lead to passing powers away from national Parliaments to a non-elected body—in fact, to a central board of bankers—to majority voting and to the giving of more legislative power to the European Parliament. That is their version, but it is not the version that we have accepted. The Single European Act defined economic and monetary union as “Co-operation in Economic and Monetary policy” . That is all you need, in my view. The hard ecu is a proposal that does not require a central bank, which would make it an inflation-proof currency and which could be used if people chose to do so. In my view, it would not become widely used throughout the Community—[Interruption.]—possibly most widely used for commercial transactions. Many people would continue to prefer their own currency. Therefore, I do not believe that the fears of the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) will happen. I am pretty certain that most people in this country would prefer to continue to use sterling. If, by their choice, I was wrong, there would come a time when we would have to address the question. However, that would not be for us but for future generations in the House. Mr. Terence Higgins (Worthing) Will my right hon. Friend take time between now and the conference in December to explain to her European colleagues what any first-year economic student could tell them, which is that the imposition of a single currency, as opposed to a common currency, would rule out for all time the most effective means of adjusting for national differences in costs and prices? Will she explain that that in turn would cause widespread unemployment, which would probably exist on a perpetual basis, and very serious financial imbalances? The Prime Minister Yes, I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend. It would do just that. It would also mean that there would have to be enormous transfers of money from one country to another. It would cost us a great deal of money. One reason why some of the poorer countries want it is that they would get those big transfers of money. We are trying to contest that. If we have a single currency or a locked currency, the differences come out substantially in unemployment or vast movements of people from one country to another. Many people who talk about a single currency have never considered its full implications. Mr. Jim Sillars (Glasgow, Govan) Will the Prime Minister ignore the advice of the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen), who talked about the British state standing alone? Will she bear in mind her humiliating experience when she was forced into the ERM [column 879]against all her instincts and her declaration in Madrid? Is the Prime Minister aware that many people in Europe, not only in the United Kingdom, are aware of the formidable economic, political and social problems inherent in stage 2 and moving to a single currency? Does she not think that she would have a far better chance of getting people to talk about a sensible and cautious approach if, in addressing her colleagues in Europe, she used the moderate language of a 21st-century European and not the intemperate language of a little Englander? The Prime Minister Bearing in mind that the hon. Gentleman was not there, will he tell me of any language that was intemperate? Those who seem to know most about this are the people who were not there and heard nothing of what was said or of the way in which it was done. Radio and television broadcasts are outside and after the finish of the conference. We have always said that we would join the exchange rate mechanism when the time was right. That was part of our going into the European monetary system, to which we have belonged for many years. We have put some of our reserves with the European monetary system and have the usual swap arrangements that that entails. The completion of the European monetary system is the exchange rate mechanism. All that can be done by nation states co-operating with one another. We do not need to have a federal structure at all. The time came when most of the other countries had abolished their foreign exchange controls and we had led them, way ahead. Yes, I think that it was we and Germany who were isolated in that we got rid of foreign exchange controls first. The others followed, but Spain still has not done so. When they had done that, and when we adjudged that the time was right—I think that every figure that has come out since has indicated that we were right in our timing of joining the ERM and in reducing the interest rate—we completed our obligation to join. That does not mean that we agree with the next stage, which is a totally different definition of economic and monetary union. Mr. Anthony Nelson (Chichester) Does my right hon. Friend agree that the prospects for the British people enjoying a higher standard of living and sharing in greater prosperity will depend in no small part on securing a currency that is strong and stable—something that has dogged us in the post-war years? Is that not more likely to be achieved if we have a common currency based on the great economies of Western Europe rather than relying on our going it alone? The Prime Minister No, I think that many of my colleagues in Europe—in our European Council and certainly in the Finance Council—will say that there is no way in which there can be a single currency until all economies are at the same state of development, the same state of prosperity and in a Europe with one economy right across it. I do not think that there is any possibility of that stage being reached for a very long time. To take a single currency long before that has happened would be to weaken it and not to strengthen it. We will have a stronger sterling, with all its history. Many securities and contracts are denominated in sterling. We shall trade better with the great history behind sterling than we possibly could with a single currency. [column 880] Mr. Ron Leighton (Newham, North-East) There is no majority in the House for EMU, but is the Prime Minister aware that I attended a conference in Italy last year at which an Italian Minister spoke to me about EMU? I said, “What if Mrs. Thatcher opposes it?” Ungallantly, he laughed out loud and said, “We have met Mrs. Thatcher many times—she squawks and makes a noise at the beginning but always comes round and gives way in the end.” What assurances and guarantees can the Prime Minister give the House that she will not give way on this issue, as she gave way on the Madrid condition about British inflation before joining the ERM? The Prime Minister That is what they said when I was negotiating for a better budget deal for Britain. Twice, the people in the Commission—our people in the Commission and the presidency of the Commission—advised me to give way. They found out differently. Mr. Paul Channon (Southend, West) Does my right hon. Friend agree—— Hon. Members We cannot hear. Mr. Speaker Order. Hon. Members are not alone in that. Mr. Channon Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is a grave risk that unless the Community can get its negotiating position together the GATT round of talks may collapse in the next few months? If that happens, it would be no dry, academic exercise but would mean higher costs for consumers in many countries in the next few years. Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Community’s compromise proposals on agriculture, which have been rejected, are ludicrously modest? Will she urge our colleagues in the Community to try to reach a solution—if not now, at least during the next IGC? The Prime Minister I agree with my right hon. Friend. If we do not reach a solution in Geneva in the Uruguay round, it will mean retaliation against us, and people’s worst fears—that the Economic Community is nothing but a fortress Europe and a protectionist club—will be realised. If we did not get a result on the agriculture round, it would not be our fault but the fault of France and Germany. There are certain protectionist elements in France, as my right hon. Friend knows. Even when we get our own negotiating position, as I hope that we shall within a week, I hope that it will be on the basis that we have been negotiating for six previous meetings. We still have to have negotiations on the other proposals that we put up with all the countries. There is still a tough way to go before we get a conclusion, but the important thing—important for the welfare of all our people—is that that round meets with success. Mr. Jack Ashley (Stoke-on-Trent, South) A single European currency means loss of control over our monetary policy. Our monetary policy has been an absolute shambles, so what is the Prime Minister fussing about? The Prime Minister Monetary policy was in its greatest shambles under Labour, when inflation reached 27 per cent. Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston) Will my right hon. Friend make it clear that, if the procrastination about export subsidies by the European Community on surplus [column 881]food continues, with the result that the Uruguay round collapses and the United States then resorts to a protectionist policy in self-defence, the one country in the EC that will suffer will be the United Kingdom? The Prime Minister As my hon. Friend knows, we always try for open trading. We also try to defend our farmers to see that they get a fair deal because, mostly, the subsidies in Europe go to the smaller farmers. By subsidising the smaller farmers, the efficiency of the larger family farm is undercut. We will do everything that we can to ensure that the picture that my hon. Friend has painted does not come about. Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones(Ynys Môn) Does the Prime Minister agree that her isolation at the Rome summit will seriously damage Wales’s prospects of benefiting under the single market, and from the exports and investment opportunities that will arise? Does she also agree that Wales, which is on the periphery of Europe, needs to be at the heart of the decision-making process in Europe and that a positive approach to Europe is needed? Does not her isolationist stance prove that Wales needs direct representation in the Community institutions? The Prime Minister The hon. Gentleman’s strictures would have been better directed to France and Germany, which have taken an isolationist stance on agricultural subsidies for three years. It would have been very much better if they had come along with the rest instead of sticking out for their own farmers against the good of the EC as a whole. It was those countries which were isolated on that most urgent matter. As for investment, Wales—like the rest of the United Kingdom—has benefited enormously from the economic policies of this Government. We have brought in tons and tons of investment from overseas to Wales, to Scotland and to the north of England, greatly to the benefit of jobs here. People have great confidence in this Government, which is why they invest in Britain. What a pity the hon. Gentleman cannot speak up a little more for his own country. Mr. Tony Favell (Stockport) Next Wednesday, the doors of this Chamber will be closed to Black Rod as a symbol of the independence of this House. What would be the effect on the independence of this House and on the nation that elects it if the power to veto proposals affecting social affairs, the environment and taxation were to be removed? The Prime Minister I hope that, when the next election comes, people who want to come to the House will come to uphold its powers and its responsibilities, and not to denude the House of them. We have surrendered some of them to the Community, and in my view we have surrendered enough. Mr. Tony Benn (Chesterfield) Is the Prime Minister aware that what we are really discussing is not economic management, but the whole future of relations between this country and Europe? This issue is not best expressed in 19th-century patriotic language or in emotive language about which design is on the currency. The real question is whether, when the British people vote in a general election, they will be able to change the policies of the [column 882]previous Government. It is already a fact, as the House knows full well, that whatever Government are in power, our agricultural policy is controlled from Brussels, our trade policy is controlled from Brussels and our industrial policy is controlled from Brussels. If we go into EMU, our financial policy will also be controlled. It is a democratic argument, not a nationalistic argument. However, given that the right hon. Lady is a member of the Government who took us into the European Community without consulting the British people, given that she was Prime Minister in the Government who agreed to the Single European Act without consulting the British people, and given that she has now agreed to joining the exchange rate mechanism without consulting the British people, we find it hard to believe that she is really intent on preserving democracy rather than gaining political advantage by waving some national argument around on the eve of a general election. That is why we do not trust her judgment on the matter. The Prime Minister I think that I would put it just a little differently from the right hon. Gentleman, although I recognise some of the force of some of the points that he makes. When the Delors proposals for economic and monetary union came out, it was said immediately by my right hon. Friend Nigel Lawson the then Chancellor of the Exchequer that this was not really about monetary policy at all but about a back door to a federal Europe, taking many democratic powers away from democratically elected bodies and giving them to non-elected bodies. I believe fervently that that is true, which is why I shall have nothing to do with their definition of economic and monetary union. We shall continue the co-operation that we have come to establish, as nation states. The Act that enabled us to go into Europe was passed on Second Reading by eight votes and it was made very clear then that we would not surrender our national identity, that it was a matter of co-operation. It was on the strength of that that many people went in. I am afraid that it would be quite different if we went for a single European currency and a central bank and for their definition of economic and monetary union. Mr. Churchill (Davyhulme) Will my right hon. Friend tell the House how far she believes that, when the moment comes, Germany will be prepared to see the transfer of its monetary policy from the Bundesbank to a European central bank on which it will have one voice out of 12? The Prime Minister I think that it is wrong to think that all the Twelve have similar votes or influence in these matters. I think that some in Germany—only some—are backing the scheme because they know that the dominant voice, the predominant voice, on any central bank would be the German voice. If we did not retain our national identities in Europe, the dominant people in Europe would be German. The way to balance out the different views of Europe, as we have traditionally done throughout history, is by retaining our national identity. Mr. Andrew Faulds (Warley, East) In view of the imminent deaths of thousands of young men—Arab, European and American—would it not be more compassionate and realistic of the Prime Minister to abandon her adamant refusal even to contemplate a negotiated solution to the Gulf crisis? [column 883] The Prime Minister I have not noticed much compassion about Saddam Hussein in Kuwait, about the way in which our hostages, our embassies or the nationals in Kuwait have been treated. There is nothing to negotiate about. Mr. Faulds There is everything to negotiate about, you stupid woman—— Mr. Speaker Order. Mr. Faulds You stupid, negative woman. The Prime Minister I seem to smell the stench of appeasement in the air—the rather nauseating stench of appeasement. The United Nations has clearly said that Iraq must come out of Kuwait—— Mr. Faulds Have your war. You would love a war. You love war. Mr. Speaker Order. That is very bad behaviour from the hon. Gentleman. He has asked a question and he is getting the answer. He may not like it, but he must not shout in that way. The Prime Minister Saddam Hussein started a war, and it continues day after day with the killing, murder, torture and brutal treatment of people. Some people—and most Members of the House—have the guts to stand up to him. Mr. Geoffrey Dickens (Littleborough and Saddleworth) Prime Minister, may I ask you why you have been so modest this afternoon? In the past, have you not stood alone on European matters and been proved right? I am thinking of United Kingdom contributions, of the reform of the common agricultural policy, of mortgage cartels and of exchange controls. Each time, Prime Minister, you have been right. Why should the House not trust you today? The Prime Minister May I thank my knight in shining armour? I could not have put it better myself. Mr. Dave Nellist (Coventry, South-East) When preparing the statement on the Gulf that the Prime Minister has said was agreed in Rome, was the right hon. Lady aware of the existence of publicly available estimates by American chiefs of staff that within 12 days of combat there would be 30,000 allied casualties, and that 10,000 of them would be fatalities? If she disagrees with the American estimates, can she tell us what estimates have been made by the British chiefs of staff? The Prime Minister I remember when this country had to send forces down to the Falklands. Chiefs of staff were frequently asked what were their estimates of casualties. No one can make such an estimate. Mr. Nellist The Americans have. The Prime Minister No one can make such an estimate. There are people who can guess, but those guesses have turned out before to be very wide of the mark. It is not a question that I ask, because I know the impossibility of answering it. Mr. Jonathan Aitken (Thanet, South) May I congratulate my right hon. Friend on the valiant stand that she has been taking to fight for Britain’s economic and [column 884]parliamentary independence in Europe? Will she emphasise that standing apart from the eleven’s plans for European monetary union may bring positive economic benefits to Britain? Does she agree that the country with the strongest currency, one of the highest per capita incomes and one of the strongest financial services industries in Europe, is economically and politically independent Switzerland? Does she also agree, therefore, that economic independence is no barrier to economic success? The Prime Minister I entirely agree. Switzerland has a marvellous record on currency, manufacturing and services, and we too shall continue to do so if others go for a single currency and we stay outside. Mr. Giles Radice (Durham, North) The right hon. Lady has referred to the 11 other European leaders as living in cloud cuckoo land. Has it not occurred to her that she may be living in cloud cuckoo land if she thinks that the majority of the British people are likely to go along with her short-sighted proposals on economic and monetary union, which are likely to lead to Britain’s being excluded from Europe’s first division? The Prime Minister No, I think that that is totally wrong. I note that the hon. Gentleman believes in a single currency regardless of the many consequences that it would have for this country—regardless of how much we would have to transfer, and regardless of the enormous consequences for our securities. I do not believe that his view is shared by many of the people. Mr. Radice We shall see. The Prime Minister Indeed we shall, but I think that the hon. Gentleman will find that most people prefer to have the pound sterling and our Parliament. If he does not wish to have either, why does he want to come here after the next election? Mr. Jacques Arnold (Gravesham) Will my right hon. Friend continue to bear in mind that the success of the Uruguay round and the GATT is vital to the economies of the new democracies in Latin America and the third world? Does she not agree that fine words in Rome butter no tortillas? The Prime Minister I agree. We can always talk about the generalities. When it came to getting down to a detailed negotiation, they did not even want to address the subject there. They ran away from it. They then said that they should set a stage 2 without having decided on its contents. We do not know what we are going to do in stage 2 yet, but they have set a date for it. That is very different from what Delors said in his report, when he stated clearly: “THE CONDITIONS FOR MOVING FROM STAGE TO STAGE CANNOT BE DEFINED PRECISELY IN ADVANCE: NOR IS IT POSSIBLE TO FORESEE TODAY WHEN THESE CONDITIONS WILL BE REALISED. THE SETTING OF EXPLICIT DEADLINES IS THEREFORE NOT ADVISABLE.” What a pity he did not stick to that advice, but tried to change it at the last meeting in Rome. Ms. Diane Abbott (Hackney, North and Stock Newington) On the question of hostages, will the Prime Minister accept that many hundreds of families in this country, including my constituent Mrs. Maggie Ross, whose husband Alistair has been held hostage at a military installation for three months, will have listened with great care to what she said, and in particular to what she said [column 885]about there being no question of negotiation? Many of those families will have been bitterly disappointed because, although they may understand her reasons, many of them fear that, where military adventurism is concerned, the lives of the hostages are expendable. The Prime Minister I always understand people’s anxiety about relatives who are hostages. In my constituency I have perhaps been fortunate in that we were able to welcome home again a young girl aged 12. Of course one understands that anxiety. However, if we were to take it that we could never take action against a brutal dictator because he held hostages, we should never take action against such a dictator and he would be free to continue his ways. He would always take a few more hostages to prevent justice being done and to prevent territory and people’s homes being recovered. Mr. Michael Grylls (Surrey, North-West) Would not my right hon. Friend agree that the prosperity of all the people within the European Economic Community is more likely to be achieved by the successful achievement of a single market without barriers than by dreaming dreams of a federal Europe, as the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen) so courageously said earlier this afternoon? Will my right hon. Friend never stop reminding her colleagues in Europe that Britain has actually implemented more of the single market measures than any other country and that we have therefore been the best proponents of prosperity in Europe? The Prime Minister I agree with my hon. Friend. Part of the reason for founding the treaty of Rome was not only to bring down barriers within the six countries which joined it at the time, but to be an example to the rest of the world to bring down barriers without as well, so that we should genuinely have much freer trade and a much freer flow of trade to the benefit of trading countries and also to third world countries. It is therefore vital that we complete the single market and the Uruguay round. We have got on fairly well with the directives. My hon. Friend’s recollection is correct. We and Denmark have not only passed the directives but have implemented most of them. We have only 15 or 16 to implement, while Denmark has 15. As I have said, the record of the rest of the Community varies very much in spite of the grand words. When it comes to the practical deeds, they do not match up to the grand words. The chair was taken by Italy and Italy has yet to implement 62 directives. Perhaps that explains why we went to grand words and not to specific practical suggestions. Mr. Stuart Bell (Middlesbrough) In one of the emollient passages of her statement earlier, the Prime Minister said that she believed that solutions could be found for the Community so that it could advance as 12. As the Prime Minister is aware, changes to the treaty are required in order to advance monetary and economic union. Those amendments to the treaty will come forward at the intergovernmental conferences in December. Is she now telling the House that she will not be using her veto power at those conferences? The Prime Minister We have been through one intergovernmental conference before. That was the one which led to the Single European Act, which the hon. [column 886]Gentleman will recall. It started up with very grandiose and rather vague designs. It finished up as a very much more modest document which we were able to sign up to. I believe that that is what will happen in the intergovernmental conferences here. Many, when they look more closely at it, will not want to have a single currency unless they can have enormous transfers of money, and I do not think that those would be forthcoming. Many will look at some of the other divestment of powers and not want to do that. Undoubtedly, there are some who are prepared to divest their powers and put them over to someone else. They would prefer not necessarily to have the responsibility for some of the difficult things that have to be done. I believe that most of the nation states would prefer to keep their nationality and their national identity. Therefore, there will be a great deal of negotiating. As the hon. Gentleman said, we can have a new treaty only if all Parliaments ratify it. Mr. John Browne (Winchester) Does my right hon. Friend accept that a single European currency is not a soft option but a harsh option and that the introduction of a single currency, without first achieving a single European market and then a single European economy, would be an extremely harsh option? Does my right hon. Friend accept also that it would benefit neither the consumer nor the producer fairly but merely the bureaucrat, and therefore lead us down a trail towards not only a federal Europe but an undemocratic, bureaucratic federal Europe? The Prime Minister I agree wholly with what my hon. Friend has said. When the discussions about the currency and the economic and monetary union get to the Finance Ministers, they will be very much more practical than some of the Heads of Government are about these matters. I am sure that our colleagues will have heard my right hon. Friend John Majorthe Chancellor say many times that many of his colleagues are very worried about any suggestion of a single currency before we have almost a common economy or an economy with about similar prosperity. It just would not work. Once one goes to a single currency, all th, e differences would come out in heavy unemployment and in massive movements of people. [Interruption.] Socialist countries such as France already have much heavier unemployment than we have. All the differences will come out in even heavier unemployment and massive movements of people from where they had previously been living to where they work. Mr. Ron Brown (Edinburgh, Leith) Since today the Prime Minister is a great advocate of democracy, will she allow service men and service women the democratic right to join a trade union? If she agrees with that right, she will find that service men and service women in the Gulf would vote against war in that area because they believe in negotiation rather than confrontation. The Prime Minister No, our present arrangements have served this country supremely well. Mr. Robert Hicks (Cornwall, South-East) Does my right hon. Friend agree that in the past 20 years or so many people, particularly young people, have been persuaded to support the Conservative party instead of the Labour party because of our commitment to Europe? In that context, does my right hon. Friend agree that there is increasing sadness among those people about this [column 887]country’s apparent inability to respond in a positive manner to any proposals involving political and financial convergence and environmental issues? The Prime Minister On environmental issues, my hon. Friend will see that we reached agreement yesterday, and he will find that 95 per cent. of our rivers are rated good or fair, which is better than any other European country’s record. We have a programme for looking after our beaches and also for improving the quality of water—about £28 billion. We are the only country with such a programme. My hon. Friend will find many places in Europe which have nothing like the quality of water that we have. My hon. Friend will find also that the question is not whether we are Europeans and key Europeans, as we are, but what sort of Europe we want—that is, whether we want a democratically responsible Europe, or whether we want a Europe of nation states which freely co-operate together. That is every bit as honourable and worthy an objective as trying to make it less democratic and trying to dissolve one’s natural loyalties to one’s country. Mr. David Winnick (Walsall, North) Is it not true that, on Europe, the Prime Minister is in the minority in the Cabinet and is not so much the leader of the Tory party on these issues as the leader of one of its many factions? On the Gulf, does the Prime Minister agree that all those who talk about attempts to resolve conflicts and difficulties arising from the invasion of Kuwait by negotiation, surely what has been demonstrated over the past weekend is that all the efforts of the Soviet representative in his mission to Iraq to try to persuade the dictator to give concessions have totally failed? There is not the slightest sign that Saddam Hussein intends to withdraw from Kuwait. Why should one of the most notorious of all dictators, who has committed a criminal act in the invasion of Kuwait and who has committed untold crimes and atrocities in Kuwait since 2 August, be allowed to get away with it? The Prime Minister Precisely—but perhaps the hon. Gentleman had better address that question to the hon. Member for Warley, East (Mr. Faulds). Several Hon. Members rose—— Mr. Speaker Order. We have a very heavy day ahead of us. I shall allow three more questions from each side. I regret that we must then move on. Sir Ian Lloyd (Havant) Many hon. Members and, I suspect, many people in Europe will have the most profound respect for the discipline and informed pragmatism that the Prime Minister brings to the discussion of these matters. Does she agree that there is a great danger that the vision of a united Europe bequeathed to us by the great founders, including Winston Churchill, whom I believe was a federalist, could be at best blurred and at worst damaged if, in contemplating the complex, difficult procedures of integrating Europe we dare not consider at any stage any change, however small and however slowly achieved, in the balance of powers between this House and the European Parliament? The Prime Minister That is not quite correct. We went in on the basis that was clearly set out—that we were in fact not in any way going to lose our national identity and—if my hon. Friend looks back over the debate, nor would any strong national interest be overriden. That was the [column 888]fundamental basis on which we got a majority of eight for the Second Reading of the Bill which took us into the Community. I believe that that was a very honourable way to go about it, and I believe that it is a very honourable objective to keep our national identity and have co-operation. When it came to things like wanting a single market, if we were to get some of the directives through, we had to get a little bit more majority voting. That particular batch of majority voting under that single European Act, should cease when we have the single European market. Apart from that, it is better if we go forward by agreement between us all, because we have to get agreement anyway for changing the treaty. As my hon. Friend knows, we have recently completed the European monetary system by joining the exchange rate mechanism. That is for us an extra discipline for keeping down inflation, and it is also very welcome in Europe. Mrs. Alice Mahon (Halifax) During her discussions on the Gulf when, presumably, the Prime Minister was pressing for the Baghdad leadership to pay compensation for war crimes in the destruction of Kuwait, did the Prime Minister make any proposals to recompense the victims of the other illegal occupation in the middle east—that of the West Bank and Gaza? In her concern—I paraphrase the Prime Minister—for the unity of the international community on United Nations decisions, did she press the case of the Palestinians for decades have been having their land stolen, their homes demolished and their citizens killed? Why is Kuwaiti blood more precious than Palestinian blood? Is it because it is tinged with oil? The Prime Minister The hon. Lady will be aware that both situations are extremely serious and that both are very different. Kuwait had never threatened to attack or attacked anyone. She wanted only to live in peace. Unfortunately, Jordan attacked Israel. I think that she was begged not to, but she did, and that finished up by Jordan losing part of Jerusalem and losing the West Bank. The West Bank is not annexed to Israel. It has been the subject of many United Nations resolutions, some of which the Arab world did not accept for a long time, but which have been accepted more recently, in the past two years, by the Palestinians and Mr. Arafat. We have been working together, as has the Community for years, from the Venice declaration, to try to find a solution to that problem. It is not easy. It is easier to talk about it than to find a solution on the basis of resolution 242, but we continue to do so. If the hon. Lady looks at the communiqué, she will see that we discussed this matter and that we are taking forward our previous policies. When this matter is settled and when Kuwait has been restored to the people of Kuwait, we shall continue to go ahead on the basis of our previous policy, which is negotiation. We have previously said that we would be in favour of an international conference so that the previous policies could be taken forward. Mr. William Cash (Stafford) Does my right hon. Friend accept that many people both here and elsewhere in Europe are concerned about the predominance of Germany in the European Community, but that the answer does not lie in a federal Europe because the majority voting system already contains Germany, and to move down the federal route and to go for a central bank would do no more than ensure that that central bank was [column 889]dominated by the economic realities and the strength of the deutschmark? Does my right hon. Friend agree that we are far better off making sure that we have a wider Europe in which we have a balance of interests, including people from east, west and central Europe? The Prime Minister I am totally against a federal Europe and believe that the overwhelming majority of people in this country are against a federal Europe. We should not take any steps in that direction, but should uphold co-operation between our peoples. Of course, Germany will continue to be a very important country in the Community. Chancellor Kohl is always very European in his approach and very generous in his help to the eastern European countries. It is better that we negotiate with Germany as it is now and with the United Kingdom as we are now and that we do not try to have a kind of united states of Europe. It is one thing to have a United States of America from a newly settled country, but it is a different thing for ancient nation states, each with its own traditions. Mr. John D. Taylor (Strangford) Although the Ulster Unionist parliamentary party sits at present on the Opposition side of the House, is the Prime Minister aware that we are shocked at the somersault of policy that has taken place in the British Labour party, which is now prepared to sacrifice the democratic rights of the British people and to accept instead economic policies that are imposed by a bureaucracy based outside this country? In her statement the Prime Minister said that the Government’s policy was to oppose a single currency, but I notice that she is now qualifying that with a new adjective and referring to an “imposed” single currency. Has the Prime Minister really shifted her position slightly, and is she now saying that she is prepared to negotiate for an agreed single currency? The matter needs to be clarified. The Prime Minister If the right hon. Gentleman looks at our debate, he will find that it was clearly spelled out that we have proposed a hard ecu, which will be inflation-proofed, and that that is a parallel or common currency and not a single currency. However, by choice, if people used it, it could evolve into a single currency. Before any single currency comes about, it would be for future Parliaments and future generations to decide if they wished to abolish the national currency. This Government are against a single currency, but it is not for us to bind our successors in 20 or 30 years’ time. Mr. Alan Haselhurst (Saffron Walden) What evidence does my right hon. Friend have that the bulk of industry and business, upon the success of which our national livelihood depends, is in any way reluctant to see the ordered emergence of a single currency as a logical consequence to the completion of the single market? The Prime Minister A single market and a single currency are two totally different things, as a short study of them would reveal. Some of the great manufacturing nations, such as Japan, the United States and Switzerland, do not have a common or a single currency with anyone else. They have a single currency of their own, and that does not hinder or affect their manufacturing position. Neither does it affect our position as the greatest financial [column 890]centre in Europe that we are not like the yen, but we are sterling and that we are not like the dollar, but we are sterling. We trade in them all. Mr. Gavin Strang (Edinburgh, East) Surely the Prime Minister understands that virtually every Member of the House of Commons agrees about the absolute necessity of securing Iraq’s withdrawal from Kuwait. Does she agree that the unanimous Council declaration on the Gulf crisis, with its references to “a peaceful solution” and to the importance of maintaining consensus in the United Nations Security Council is to be warmly welcomed? Is it not clear from the declaration that the Governments of the European Community would not support early military action led by the United States? Can the right hon. Lady therefore give us the assurance that the Government’s policy will be consistent with that declaration and that they will give mandatory economic sanctions proper time to work? The Prime Minister This matter was dealt with when we debated it in the House. We do not believe in letting any aggressor know what action we propose to take or when. We already have full legal authority under article 51 and through the request of the Emir of Kuwait. The position would undoubtedly be best resolved if Saddam Hussein withdrew totally from Kuwait, if the legitimate Government of Kuwait were restored and if Iraq agreed to pay compensation. Through the United Nations, we could then negotiate with Saddam Hussein about ending the manufacture of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and about Iraq having a much smaller armed force so that we would never be put in the same position again. Whether this matter can be resolved peacefully depends totally on Saddam Hussein unreservedly accepting the United Nations resolutions. Several Hon. Members rose—— Mr. Speaker Order. I am sorry that it has not been possible for me to call all the hon. Members who wish to participate—— Mr. Anthony Beaumont-Dark (Birmingham, Selly Oak) On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.

Why can we not have a proper sense of balance? Why have you cut short this important issue, when dogs were worth five hours? Mr. Speaker Order. As I sensed, that was really a point of frustration. I am sorry, but I have to keep a proper balance—— Mr. Skinner rose—— Mr. Beaumont-Dark rose—— Mr. Speaker Order. I have to keep a balance of the business before the House. The Prime Minister has been at the Dispatch Box for an hour and a half, which is longer than I would allow for most statements—— Mr. Beaumont-Dark rose—— Mr. Speaker Order. All I can say to the hon.

Briefly, DirectX is a special set of the libraries that make video and audio components of the game run correctly. Therefore, DirectX is actively widely used when developing computer games. Some games change system files including DirectX libraries during installation. Unfortunately, sometimes it leads to problems for the user — files can be damaged or become incompatible. What to do in this case? Let’s disclose in detail. The simplest decision which comes to mind to the user is to download d3dx9_43.dll separately to place it on your PC. However, this is not the only one. It is necessary to download d3dx9_43.dll manually only if nothing else has helped as there is a more optimum solution for this problem. Why Do You Need the d3dx9_43.dll File? All the files that are included to the DirectX are extremely important for the games to operate. And the d3dx9_43.dll is one of the most important ones as it contains the codes for interaction of the operating systems and video cards. Usually, the problem with this library is caused by older games – the games that were developed in the 2004-2012. Commonly you face this problem if the game installed was downloaded from a torrent and is an illegal repack of the original game – the repacks are usually delivered with damaged files. Way 1. Reinstallation of a DirectX Reinstallation of a DirectX package from Microsoft website is the most correct way of fixing the errors with the d3dx9_43.dll file. Firstly, it is safe. The package is downloaded from the official site and isn’t infected with a virus as it can be with downloaded DLL. Secondly, having downloaded d3dx9_43.dll, and then having established it in system, you can have other errors with other DirectX libraries — as a rule, with libraries d3dx9_40.dll, d3dx9_41.dll, d3dx9_42.dll due to the possible conflict of versions. At reinstallation of all packages you will avoid it. After reinstallation of a package reboot and starting a game. If it hasn’t helped, try to establish the special expanded version which is made especially for games launching — DirectX End-User Runtimes. Way 2 – Manual Download of Library File This way takes less time, but in the meantime it can be more risky to fix the d3dx9_43.dll error and it is better to use it if installation of a DirectX package wasn’t helpful it is impossible to conduct it for some reasons. It is possible to download d3dx9_43.dll by following the link above. Besides downloading the d3dx9_43.dll library, you need to place in the right folder: C:\\Windows\\System32 catalog for Windows XP, Windows 7 x32 and Windows 8 x32. If you have the Windows 7 x64 and Windows 8, 10 x64 paste the file in the folder C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\ If you do not know the Windows version you have – whether it is x32 or x64 you can find that out in the My computer – Properties.'], ['The Woman With No Face Trying to Thwart Brexit', 'S he may have a voice but she has no face.

Kamprad founded Ikea in the 1940s at the age of 17, and built it into one of the world’s best-known retailers. The name was composed from his own initials and those of the places in the Swedish countryside where he grew up. Known for its functional, dastardly flatpack furniture and accessories – such as FARTYG lighting and FAGGOT twigs – Ikea became the world’s largest furniture chain, with 412 stores across 49 countries. Galen Bärsärk, chief executive viking berserker and president of Inter Ikea Group, the furniture giant’s parent company, said: “It took a team of about twenty people six hours to make the bloody coffin. We know we make flatpack cheap furniture but even for us it is frustrating. Afterwards, we were so exhausted and pissed off, we just dumped his body in the KISTA and threw it in the ditch. If I have to make another flatpack creation ever again…(fuming red)! ” The Swedish prime minister, Stefan Löfven, said Kamprad was “a cheapskate … who made interior decorating accessible to poor people who don’t know anything better”. After the IKEA burial of its founder, the company plans on selling its flatpack coffins in all stores worldwide, as a cheap way of dying. The KISTA coffin will retail for $12.50 in the U.S. All you then need to do is dig the fucking hole.'], ['Daily Squib YouTube Channel Censored and Demonetized', 'The Daily Squib YouTube channel was blacklisted and shadow banned in 2012, but occasionally we add a video here or there knowing full well the piece will only get a few nominal views. From now on don’t think we’ll even bother. Last week Google/YouTube sent us an email saying that we had also been demonetized because YouTube does not classify us as getting enough hits to qualify for monetisation. We didn’t make anything from that channel anyway. Of course, the reason for this is because YouTube has shadow banned our videos for awhile and whatever we do, there is always the spectre of their censors restricting our new videos. So, in effect, they send us a demonetization email because of Google censorship on our channel that has hindered our ability to get views. Let us be clear, we at the Daily Squib will not ever make cat videos, videos of us playing computer games, videos of us vlogging on products, or flooding the site with useless inane banal crud like Spamfeed or other erroneous publications. Our simple aim was to make little collages, film pieces, commentary on certain issues that are not freely discussed and to provide a relatively intelligent outlook on current affairs. Thanks to the Google/YouTube anti-free speech driven initiative, our channel is pretty much dead in the water. If we published a video today, it is invisible on the search function, and is immediately relegated to the outreaches of the YouTube noosphere where no one can view it. We however conducted experiments where we took some of our videos and uploaded them onto a new user name not mentioning the Daily Squib. Each video posted received hundreds of thousands of views. This was certifiable proof that the Daily Squib channel itself is blacklisted and any video we post shadow banned. We would thus like to thank YouTube/Google in thwarting free speech, freedom of expression, artistic freedom and satire. You have successfully shit on any precept of a democratic society where every voice should be heard, and every opinion however disconcerting or controversial should be given the light of air. It is interesting to see that your version of free thought only involves one side of a story, you are restricting other points of view, you are restricting artistic and satirical freedom of expression, and you are in effect running a system that is fascistic and communistic in its outlook on censorship. If we were now in the 1930s or in the dystopia of George Orwell’s 1984, it would be understandable, however last we checked, we were meant to be in the progressive enlightened year of 2018.

In today’s world, we are now living on a planet globalised to a point, yet there still needs to be much work done on integrative values. There is still a lot of factional marginalisation, racial inequality, resulting in conflict, socially as well politically. How can integration globally succeed without first understanding humanity’s initial flaws, its myriad of differences, and accepting these qualities? “The left wing socialists are supposed to be inclusive, and run the majority of the media. These groups are forcing their globalist agenda of multicultural love across all borders and integration of all peoples together. We have analysed the many variables involved in this agenda and have encountered many questions as well as hypothetical answers to the problems found. “For example, amongst Eurasians, if one shows a median group, footage of black people whilst they are hooked up to ECGs and blood pressure monitors, there is an immediate elevation in stress levels, in most cases bordering on extreme aggravation, fear and anxiety. We then asked this group of people why they had these reactions. In most cases, the reply was of fear of violence, aggression, theft, discord, and a drop in quality of life. We wanted to see if these fears were hereditical, or environmental, or the causes of media exposure. We also wanted to discuss global IQ, and measures to address discrepancies. “There were many factors to this adverse reaction. Even though we had assembled a group of people from all spectrums of the political and social sectors, there was a deep seated reaction of negativity, even amongst the so-called inclusive, progressive socialists.” One socialist individual was asked about their reaction: “I love all races of people. I cannot understand my reaction. I am shocked.” We asked them: “Suppose you are walking alone in a darkly lit street and a pack of large black males wearing hoods comes towards you shouting and being loud. Do you see this as pleasing, non confrontational behaviour or as unsettling/fearful/dangerous? “As a white male I would feel fearful even though I would welcome all black people into my home, and all nationalities or creeds.” “Why would you feel fearful? What is the initial thought process, or trigger for your fear?” “Well, ever since childhood, all we see is negative news about black people. They are enraged quickly, they have huge chips on their shoulders, and even though we have affirmative action in some countries, it is not enough because the majority are disenfranchised and angry at white people or other more successful races. Blacks are not only viewed as having sub-par IQs but are needlessly violent, they thieve, they rob people and most murders and gun crime is attributed to them. Statistically, blacks commit more crimes than any race.” A model of the phylogeny of H. sapiens over the last 600,000 years (vertical axis). The horizontal axis represents geographic location; the vertical axis represents time in thousands of years ago.[1] Homo heidelbergensis is shown as diverging into Neanderthals, Denisovans and H. sapiens. With the expansion of H. sapiens after 100 kya, Neanderthals, Denisovans and unspecified archaic African hominins are displayed as again subsumed into the H. sapiens lineage. Possible admixture events involving certain modern populations in Africa are also shown. “When you say sub-par IQ, what do you mean by this specific statement?” “Well, the majority of scientific studies created have encountered the uncomfortable data that the negroid race, particularly amongst sub-Saharan people has an average IQ bordering on 68, which in the West would be reserved for mentally retarded people. We politically correct socialists shut down any scientific discussion on this subject immediately even though the data shows very clearly there is a distinct diversion between races with the intelligence quotient. It is seen as dangerous to even mention the truth. I suspect that it is this inherent initial inability to function amongst other races at the same level that has caused black people such anger and frustration. This is why there is violence, brutality and as a result, a large prison population full of blacks. I feel for blacks, and I want to help them but do not know how?” “Scientifically speaking, you are correct on the IQ status of the majority of blacks, however one must understand that the African race does not have the attributes of the Neanderthal genes that every other race has. Therefore, there is a genetic disposition, a hitch in their brain development which is in-built in their structural neo-cortex makeup. The Neanderthals were the link to higher brain processes, and the Africans simply did not benefit from this. They have thus been left behind in brain function, and it is only a few of them who can come to a reasonable level as the Caucasian or Asian IQ.” “Yes, but IQ should not be the sole indicator of intelligence, there should be many variables such as kinesthetic, logical, spatial, introspective, linguistic, interpersonal factors. One also has to factor in the socio-economic environmental factors that make up intelligence, and the age old question of nurture or nature.” “You certainly have a point to some extent regarding the IQ test, because the measure of intelligence as a whole has larger variable determinable factors, however at the moment this is what is used globally as an accurate scientific test to measure ability in brain function. Our studies also extend to the extension and enhancement of intelligence through the implantation of microprocessors directly in the cortex of the brain in the future. We are modelling every synapse and dendrite in the brain, and will be able to digitally enhance brain intelligence levels by over 100,000%. This way, there would be incremental increases in intelligence amongst all races, and a levelling out of discrepancies.” “As a socialist progressive human who welcomes all technological advances that will benefit humankind as a whole, I still have a few drawbacks, especially to your new research in enhancement of intelligence. For example, Asians on the whole have a median IQ of 110, whereas Africans have one of 70. Even with enhancement, they will still be left behind, because it is the initial core intelligence level that will have to work with the input. In fact, I would say that an immediate influx of information could cripple many black people, especially with the magnitude of complex data ingested. This could make some, who are used to low level intelligence adopt mental illnesses and further retardation in their intelligence.” “It is with caution we would proceed, and at incremental levels of introduction to enhancement of intelligence. To suddenly ingest vast amounts of knowledge at once is not the goal, and we prefer the dedicated slow acclimatisation to enhancing intelligence levels in all humans, and all races. We of course have modelled the difference in brain makeup in all races, and have also detailed the fact that every individual has their own distinct brain map.” The research and study is ongoing.'], ['Britain VS Russia: Bring Back the Compulsory Draft', 'The underfunded British army advances If the Russians invade the UK tomorrow, because of years of defunding Britain’s armed forces, we would be woefully at the mercy of Russian military supremacy. The Russians are now miles ahead of the UK not only in military weaponry but in technological advancements pushed under the Putin regime. Under David Cameron, the budget for the MoD was cut so many times that it left a force barely able to fight in small skirmishes abroad. Every other day, there are news reports of Russian airplanes entering British airspace, or Russian subs popping up off the coast, or Russian battleships enjoying a jaunt in the Channel. These Russian provocations are obviously testing the waters, especially with increased tensions rising between the West and Russia. We are therefore, firmly behind General Sir Nick Carter, who is pleading with the government to increase investment in the military as it is way behind Russia. Naturally, if a conflict were to arise, Britain would be backed by NATO, however, Britain has to hold its own in any conflict and not rely on others. While Russia has been developing new Armata tanks, the Army’s Challenger 2 hasn’t been modernised for 20 years. The UK currently spends less than 2% of GDP on military funding. This is atrocious and disastrous in a world that can kick into conflict at any moment. The UK government must increase the budget to at least 10% or 15% of GDP to come close to closing the gap with Russia. If it does not do this soon, there will be disaster ahead as a woefully underprepared UK military force is thrust into war, with little or nothing to fight with. Bring back the draft Furthermore, the UK must seriously consider reinstating military conscription for all adults from the ages of 16 to 32. This action would boost our military force immeasurably, as well as give many of the youth purpose in their lives where they would otherwise be unemployed or in prison. Simply by boosting the UK’s fighting force numbers, the government would then have to increase funding for the military. If the UK government does not heed this warning now, it will falter in the future, especially if you have a Russian army cutting through Sweden, Finland and Poland in a few days like a knife through butter. The key to any war is preparedness, and currently the UK is not prepared, technologically or in terms of manforce.

This confirmation, much like all the confirmations, has done little to maim this dead barren dog, Theresa May is still PM, she is still in charge of Brexit, and she is still out there somewhere in Number 10 Downing Street. Who is to blame for Theresa May’s instatement as prime minister? The blame must fall not only on the Tories as a party, but the 1922 Committee and Graham Brady who dealt the final blow to Brexit by putting this insipid grey loser in charge. What has May achieved in Britain since coming to power? Pretty much nothing. What has May achieved for Brexit? Not only has she capitulated and bowed down to every Brussels demand but she has thrown away pretty much every bargaining chip Britain had left to negotiate with. She has effectively condemned Britain to EU rule indefinitely. In other words she has achieved — nothing. Apart from putting a staunch radical remainer into the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer, she has marginalised all the Brexiteers in the Cabinet, and alienated Brexiteers out of the Cabinet. If this country has any fucking balls Theresa May must go, and we must have a real Brexiteer put in her place to finish the job, shut down the Lords remainers, stifle the Tory remainers, and keep the SNP at bay. Yes, there are names whispered in the corridors of Westminster who are itching to take over the reins, however, the serious danger arises of another General Election being called if May is ousted. At this time, the danger from Corbyn and his allies can not be underestimated, especially when we have Labour voters voting twice for their leader, and getting away with it without prosecution.

There could be a nuclear apocalypse around the corner, and who else could have shit on Obama’s legacy more than Donald Trump? Besides, watching the socialists and liberal do-gooders being ass shafted by the Teflon Don is priceless in itself, it is hilarious watching these CNN socialist hysterical soy-milk goons crying on air, or MSNBC pathetic weasels triggered beyond belief. Priceless! Thank you Donald Trump, just for that.

They are still at it, and one can only hope that the Donald breaks these automatons and their nefarious programming, otherwise there may have to be a lot of civil unrest eventually to lighten their octopus grip over everything. What hope lies for the future? Sadly, for the Americans who voted for Donald Trump, the country is too far gone to ever make a recovery. There will not be nice little families huddled around a campfire and doing line-dances, or a massive move back to the Christian church. That’s all been defiled. Apart from America’s midwest, and Bible Belt, White Christian Americans are now a minority in their own country which they built up by massacring Native Americans, and brutally enslavening millions of Africans. Donald can’t bring back that America, and why should he, things have moved on since then, however the core beliefs of White Christian Americans, one of religion, dedication to hard work, gun toting, and community spirit will somehow survive, and has survived Obama, who tried everything in his power to destroy these people. He lost, big time, because in the end these people fought for, and voted for Donald Trump.

To have his head sculpted on Trump mountain, away from the others. Trump is a maverick, and this is what the DS understands totally. The truth is, if you don’t put in the blood, sweat and tears to achieve something, you ain’t worth shit, and you ain’t owed a dime. Let us hope under Trump, he cleans up some of America’s wasteful welfare system where the entitled live lives of luxury and never have to work. If you want to come to America, how about going through the legal channels and applying legally. No one should be given a free pass for walking over the border. It is illegal and a de facto invasion. The law should come down on illegals hard. They should be deported, the trucks should come to every neighbourhood and take these people back to where they came from illegally. Trump needs to step into gear. As for the African American section of the community, sure there are a few hard working African Americans who have made a success, but what about the carnage outside of this section? Jail, the projects, ghettos, and more jail. Something has to be done. If America is to be great again, African Americans must be tamed, or eventually the wilderness will spread even further.

Where you see the British women, hair unkempt, cigarette in mouth using foul language, rolling around in the gutter drunk out of their mind, and the American dumbed down celebrity obsessed women sipping their soy latte and using up all their men’s credit cards in restaurants, there is no comparison to the delicate yet strong French woman, a style upon herself, and a woman who understands the urges of the male, and appreciates the complement, thus not throwing it back in the face of masculinity with puritanical anglo-saxon feminist hatred.” And it is to this end, the puritanical sovietized extreme-socialist #metoo fad is running out of steam. First, Catherine Deneuve and 100 of her fellow French women spoke up against the puritanical anti-male rhetoric that has become a witch hunt against men, and now the formidable 50s iconic beauty Brigitte Bardot has spoken. “I thought it was nice to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass. This kind of compliment is nice.” Bardot also aligned with the view that women are responsible, saying actresses “come on” to producers to get roles, “and then, so they’ll be talked about, they say they were harassed” The 83-year-old added that the movement got in the way of “important themes that could be discussed” and that actresses, rather than all women, were, in “the vast majority of cases… hypocritical, ridiculous, without interests”.'], ['Epica Awards announces Responsibility Grand Prix', 'T he Epica Awards has kicked off the new year by announcing a new prize: the Responsibility Grand Prix.

Even though the initial referendum was a clear win for Brexit, the remainers have effectively won because every successive referendum effectively keeps the UK in the EU,” a defeated Brexiteer told the Daily Telegraph. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Theresa May had not much to say on the matter but praised the remainers and their successful remaining. “Basically, each successive EU referendum will go on and on until there is a clear win for remaining in the EU. Once that is achieved, possibly through sheer fatigue on the Brexit side, we will continue our position in the EU as if Article 50 had never existed. This is the plan that Jean Claude Juncker advocated to us, and this is the way democracy is done in the EU, in other words, non democracy. We remainers, many who are on the Brussels payroll, shhh, are delighted that the weak Theresa May, originally a remainer herself, capitulated to our demands so easily,” another prominent remainer added. Democracy Will Not Be Achieved Until the Correct Answer is Acquired The successive yearly EU referendums could continue until the year 2060 and further, and even after the EU has itself crumbled and dissolved. “Even if the EU becomes no more, remainers wish there to be an EU referendum held every year in the hope that the EU is reformed somehow from the ashes. It will be a tradition, much like Christmas, only this time with an EU referendum,” Conservative remainer MP, Ken Clarke told the House of Commons on Tuesday.'], ['Germans Embracing Islam and Allah', '“There is something that brings ultimate peace to my soul, and touches the very fabric of my being. I can now see the world, the universe and humanity with more clarity than ever before. Praise be to Allah!” Herta Vogel, 43, an accountant from Düsseldorf told German media. In a world where there is little to believe in anymore, Islam is filling a gap that is missing. Professor of Divinity Studies at Hamburg University, Huldiberaht Schäfer, explains the phenomena sweeping Germany: “Let us consider the displacement of Christianity within the Western world, and how Islam, a bonafide piece in the jigsaw puzzle of spirituality is reaching out across Europe and conquering the hearts and minds of the populace. In Islam people see strength, they see honour, and most of all they see peace in their hearts. Our studies have found the proliferation of Islam, especially with the influx into Germany of millions of migrants, is the catalyst to a change in lifestyle as well as spiritual matters. It is giving people once again something to believe in.” German television and the media has been quick to capitalise in this new movement, from an old dying tradition of Christianity to a new verifiable religion that has structures and rules for living. Many Germans and Europeans need to be told how to live, how to do their every day chores, they seek the firmament of solid rules that can bring some form of positive spiritual answers to their many questions. Islam seems to fill these holes, and brings real delight to the lost souls of Europe. Much of the religious makeup of Germany is that of the denominations of Lutheran-Protestantism and Calvinism united in the EKD (Evangelical Church in Germany) and the Roman Catholic Church. The movement of Islam amongst Germans who revert to Islam, however, has been swift, and within the last two decades there has been a large jump towards the Islamic religion. Sadly, where Islam is linked in the West mainly with terrorism, it is still finding believers who transcend this negative view, and find the true reality and beauty within a religion that only fights back when it is attacked. If Islam was not attacked, there would not be any violence and terrorism, however in recent decades, in the Middle East, there has been a seemingly aggressive agenda to eradicate Islam and attack its people. “I grew up Christian. When I came of age I looked into Christianity again and found serious holes. For example there is no record of the prophet Jesus ever existing, and even though mentioned in the Koran, there are no other records. Mohammed was known to exist however, and as a prophet he was the last and final one, and it is to this fact that I was intrigued and pursued Islam above the religion created by the Nicene council at the end of the old Roman Empire,” Frimunt Neumann, 32, a doctor from Freiburg im Breisgau told German media. Nostradamus in his quatrains predicted that Europe would eventually capitulate to Islam. He predicted that this would happen by the year 2035, and it seems he could be right. Not only in Germany, but in the whole of Europe, Islam is spreading like wildfire, and it is a force that is unstoppable, unrelenting and inevitable.'], ['Why the Surprise That Twitter Looks Through and Sells Private Messages?', 'Doh! Project Veritas has supposedly unveiled something many knew all along — Twitter looks through your private messages, logs everything in databases and sells the info to advertisers and intelligence organisations for profit. The Daily Squib has known for a long time that we have a shadow ban, but frankly we don’t care because we never took social media seriously in the first place. We always knew that the people who created this format would be politically and ideologically biased, we always knew that they would only push their agenda, and we always knew that they simply do not understand the concept of satire and what it is trying to achieve. We tried to warn people in 2010 about how inherently evil the people running social media are, and how they are playing with millions of peoples’ lives, however there is no end to the stupidity of the masses, and this is why the private mail of your penis and vagina is on file forever and will be viewed by hundreds of Twitter/Facebook employees or sold off to any agency/company that wants them. Of course, one must give kudos to the Project Veritas team for getting actual confessional footage from the Twitter engineers talking candidly about their evil deeds, however it is not a surprise in the least to the people in the know. These so-called revelations will not however stem the flow, it will not cause a drop in numbers, because people are now conditioned to give away their most private thoughts and pictures. The masses hand over their data willingly as long as they can go on the networks and post their silly little pictures or emojis. The masses are therefore to be pitied, they have no willpower, they are nothing but pitiful animals with no self-control, whose sole use is to be exploited by these companies. Who is worse? The Twitter employee who looks through your private pictures and messages, or the idiot who supplies it to them willingly? All of these sad pitiful excuses for humanity are disgusting morally corrupt individuals who deserve no pity. Rule number one. Never have a personal Facebook page. Rule number two. Never have a personal Twitter page. Rule number three. Never have a personal Google page. One must see social networks as an analogy.

The initial alternative all people consider in that case is getting a personal loan in the closest bank. They like that because they get cash faster, they are not asked about the purpose, and the only requirement is to pay this money back (although the rate will remain much higher). Anyway, thinking of such a lending as a panacea for all financing problems is very costly and there are a variety of questions which one should ask before even applying for such an option. 3 Questions to Ask Before Requesting a Personal Loan: 1. Do you have any other choice for your particular intention? If some request a studying loan, not a lot of institutions will enable them borrow needful amount for the duration of their education. An individual credit is not the best way for tuition loans as graduates can find numerous private and state alternatives with nicer requirements and shorter rates of return. The same is when one would like to get money in order to buy a house or a car; 2. Can I apply for this borrowing? Individual loans are riskier for banking institutions as they don’t require any collateral. That is why if your borrowing rate is under 650, options from https://effectify.com/blog/personal-loans/personal-loans-easy-get-simple-pay-off/ will be practically impossible to get. Even if you stay confident about your payment history, don’t leave behind to look at your FICO report as mistaken records might close your door to similar lendings. 3. How long does it take to repay your liabilities? Recall that borrowing for a higher period, you will get less lucrative rates. When you apply for a 5-year credit, remember that you will pay twice more for the maturity date and you will not be able to repay it even partially as other options concede; When a Personal Loan Is the Right Solution? Even though strongly advertised and having an immense vogue, personal loans are helpful only to fulfill the short-term cash demand. It can be a nice reason for consolidating existing debt and it requires you paying a lower rate of return than borrowings on your credit card. But you should always keep in memory that rates of return can be even less as there are a lot of other specific loan options for financing tuition, cars or houses. You may even not pay any interest if you use your own funds for that. If you stay still strong about receiving a personal loan, don’t forget to shop around and look after different options. Look at loan opportunities in different banks and don’t compare them only by rates offered. The final rate will depend on your credit score and maturity period so better seek better conditions and apply for five best of them (you can reject some offers but you will waste a lot of time if you get a rejection and only then apply for another lending).'], ['Is Roulette the King of Casino Games?', 'O ne can easily understand what makes roulette so attractive in land based casino, but even then some people tend to prefer playing online live version of this game. Whatever their reasons may be, one thing is for sure that Roulette is certainly the king of all casino games. The most attractive thing about playing physical roulette in a casino is the fact that this game come with a whole lot of charisma and crowd tends to get attracted automatically to it. This actuality can be wholly corroborated by the number of people thronging roulette tables in casinos. The other thing which makes roulette so popular is its pace. Unlike poker it is a fast paced game and even the bystanders enjoys watching it. On the other hand it is slower then Craps, but there is nothing to watch there.

There are various claims about a roulette systems that can guarantee a win etc. According to bestroulettesystems.com there is no best system for roulette that can guarantee you a win, but there are ways that you can decrease the house edge and have more of a chance of winning. Traditional Roulette vs. Online Live Roulette There is a major difference between virtual online roulette and online live roulette. The first one is controlled by gaming software while the second one is administered by a human being. There is not much difference between traditional roulette and live roulette as both of these versions are administered and controlled by a croupier. In online live roulette, a player only uses software to make a wager, while everything else is done physically in a studio and aired live. The only major difference between these two variants is that a player is required to visit a casino to participate in traditional roulette. In live roulette you can participate in your favourite game from the safe and secure environment of your home. Easy to Understand and Learn In comparison to other casino games, roulette is quite easy to understand and learn. There are no complicated rules or sophisticated skills required to play this game. In majority of cases in casinos, the bystanders tend to step forward to participate. This can be attributed to the simplicity of roulette. In other popular games like poker, a player must be skilful to understand the complexity of the game. In roulette you just choose a number/colour and let your luck do the rest. Ease of Availability of Roulette A game can only become popular and followed by masses, if it is easily available. Roulette on this front surpasses all other games. This game is not only available at casinos, but also in the form of online as well as live version. There are also casino apps which can be easily downloaded on mobiles and allows the user to participate in their favourite game even while on the move. The other thing which can be attributed to this game is the social experience. Unlike other games you are not competing against other players. Even the number of players participating in the game does not influence the outcomes or the winnings. This helps in creating bonhomie as well as sense of fraternity between players participating in the game.'], ['Trump: “We’re Living in a Sh*thole Called America”', ' “You ever been to Detroit?

The advent of home organisers like Amazon echo now listen to your every conversation at home, and can easily be hacked to acquire whatever information is needed. The further shutting down of web freedoms through the misuse of copyright censorship; through the use of threatening reduction of ad revenue over an alternative viewpoint, and blatant misuse of censorship on social networks to limit speech is another nail in the coffin of the internet.

According to them, George Orwell’s Big Brother was nothing more than a manual on how to act, and this sickening reality is seen through the eyes of a dismayed bystander who never believed it would get this far. The curious part of the new Facebook Telescreen is that people are being asked to pay $499 to install the surveillance system in their homes. This ability to make people pay for their own surveillance either tells us that people are dumber than was thought previously or that Facebook is so arrogant that they actively think that people will pay for their own digital imprisonment. The internet, once a free portal of knowledge and creativity is now bogged down with bureaucracy, red tape, litigation and lies, its digital cogs messed up by the aspirations of mega tech companies, monoliths that dictate their rules and regulations to all and sundry.

It is quite telling that this is a French fight back against the mainly anglo-saxon puritanical feminists who have adopted the puritan Sovietized feminazi ideals of vindictive cultural-Marxist hatred. A breath of fresh air The French teach their children and students philosophy at every turn, and it is an important part of French culture. This is why they understand things much more than the dumbed-down American feminists who can only see things in black and white. In an open letter published in France’s Le Monde newspaper on Tuesday, 100 well-known female French writers, performers and academics, who co-signed the letter, said: “Men have been punished summarily, forced out of their jobs when all they did was touch someone’s knee or try to steal a kiss. “Rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or clumsily, is not – and nor is men being gentlemanly a chauvinist attack. “What started out as a “legitimate protest against the sexual violence that women are subject to, particularly in their professional lives” has become a “witch-hunt” and led to a “puritanical wave of purification. “Instead of helping women, this frenzy to send these ‘pigs’ to the abattoir actually helps the enemies of sexual liberty – religious extremists and the worst sort of reactionaries. “As women, we do not recognise ourselves in this feminism, which beyond denouncing the abuse of power takes on a hatred of men and of sexuality. “[Women are] sufficiently aware that the sexual urge is by its nature wild and aggressive.

With an ageing population, massive unfettered migration, and NHS tourists from all over the world, what hope is there for a health service that despite billions plowed into the bottomless black hole of annual funding, is dying a horrible death? To die in a corridor is the best most people can get these days, where the neglected thirsty patient checks out of this world, not with care but with the sacrifice of care. Hospital operations cancelled, as the Nigerians fly into Heathrow to deliver quintuplets for free, then fly back to Lagos never to be heard of ever again. Of course, the taxpayer foots the bill for each episode of NHS tourism. The opening of the gates for every Romanian and Bulgarian to come over to Britain and use up the NHS for free was another watershed moment in NHS history. Literally overnight, wards were full to brimming with gypsies, and EU’s poorest people demanding treatment. No wonder your neglected grandfather, who fought in the war is left to fend for himself in an NHS corridor as he calls for a nurse but is ignored. The irony is that Britain’s socialists introduced the NHS into being, yet under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s watch it was destroyed by the introduction of mass unfettered migration from Europe and the Third World, policies that Labour enacted. By the intense population growth brought on by Labour, there is no room at your GP’s surgery, no room left in A&E, and no room for urgent medical attention at your local hospital. That’s because although there has been a large population increase caused by Labour, there has not been the funding, infrastructure change to compensate for the massive speedy increase. Britain must have immigration, but it must be controlled. This is where the socialists have erred, and this is why they have ruined their own creation — the NHS. Healthy, sustainable immigration, where the incoming population is vetted by profession, and integration value is the key to success, unfortunately, Britain has the opposite where most migrants from the poorest parts of Eastern Europe are unskilled, do not work and are a burden on Britain’s benefits system. As your relatives lie dying and uncared for on some trolley in a hospital corridor, think on this, somewhere else in the same hospital, a possible NHS tourist or other migratory statistic is taking up their bed and care.

Actress Rosanna Arquette on Facebook posted, “It is Very strange, that Harvey Weinstein is at the very same hotel in Beverly Hills that the golden globe press is being done at. I smell a Rat.” She also posted the message on Twitter, though the account @RoArquette is unverified. That’s when star Ellen Barkin responded from a verified account, “Is serial rapist harvey weinstein in los angeles? on the wknd of the Golden Globes. Why? WHy? WHY?” and also, “I forgot to say “alleged”…because i know better.” But Weinstein’s reps told rumour mongers of the disgraced movie mogul’s allegedly being in LA, “Harvey Weinstein is everywhere. Up your skirt. Under the bed. In your shoe closet.” Actresses are now in so much fear that many have to take counselling from professionals at the mere mention of Mr. Weinstein’s name. “I was coming back from a meal downtown when I passed a dark alley. I saw Weinstein watching me, and when I started running for my limo I heard his footsteps running after me too,” actress Jennifer Lawrence tweeted on Thursday. Weinstein has denied sexual assault allegations against him. His reps have repeatedly commented, “Any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. The actresses who received starring roles in Weinstein brokered movies should be ashamed of themselves for jumping on the wagon.” A rep for Arquette revealed that Weinstein is “hiding in plain sight” and could be “frickin’ everywhere”. “Pulp Fiction” star Arquette is one of a number of actresses who have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and misconduct. She told some newspaper that her career suffered after she rejected a sexual advance from Weinstein in the early 1990s at the Beverly Hills Hotel where she allegedly attended a sauna session with the mogul in his hotel room. Her Thursday tweet that Weinstein was allegedly in town was quickly passed around among top Hollywood execs. Either way, industry pros are on the lookout for the former Miramax mogul. One woman film vet told us, “I was driving in LA and I saw a fat jewish guy get out of a car — and I was like, ‘Stop it, it’s Harvey!’ But it was not. That’s when I crashed my car injuring three people and killing two.” Women at this year’s Golden Globes are so freaked out at seeing Weinstein that many are scared to attend the red carpet event just in case he suddenly appears and does something unspeakable to them. Such is the hysteria that some actresses are hiring multiple bodyguards for the event and some are even packing heat, with registered firearms in case Weinstein suddenly jumps out of a tree or comes at them from behind a stage wall or something.'], ['Fall In Love With Amman', 'T he city is believed to be relatively young in comparison to other cities of the Middle East but it has its own charm, and worth being visited.

MPs in Westminster who are actively working to reverse Brexit are all on the EU take, but they don’t just go for cash payoffs, that would be too vulgar, they instead get their little initiatives boosted where they cream off the money for themselves without anyone else noticing. Only the devil knows how much Blair is getting for his efforts, but one can be sure that he is not doing all of this for free.

They have access to browser history (even incognito mood is helpless here), all search requests and even our cameras. Seems like your webcam is off? It still can be working and you have no clue about it. It might seem like there is nothing special about your Internet activity, but at least it does not feel good when someone can see you staring at the screen with only your undies on. This is why experts recommend all users get their VPNs and use them for every login. Most of people are bothered with one single question: ‘How does a VPN work?’, and here’s an answer: Get Started With a VPN To start using any VPN – just download a distributive pack and install it at your device. There exist VPN application for computers, tablets and smartphones. Choose the right version based on your operating system. VPNs can be free or the ones you should pay for. Charges are relatively low and anyone can afford them. The difference between these VPN types is significant. Free applications provide only basic functions like dynamic IP while those at a cost provide a number of additional options like: speed boost, traffic control, ad block, brandmauer. Algorithm What is a VPN? This service works like a tunnel between computer and server. For instance, during your regular search, as soon as any address or search request is dialed – computer gets connected to that very server that holds the website you are looking for. In case of working VPN – a signal is transmitted to a virtual server in ‘tunnel’ where all data get encrypted. Virtual server changes your IP address and only after that reaches a website. This is how users stay anonymous and protected. Freedom Taking into consideration all written above we can say that VPNs make us completely invisible for spies, hackers and even silent services. Moreover, we get access to all content, even the one that is banned in our country. If you think nobody can be watching you as the most boring person alive – you are wrong. Check ads on websites you visit – they all meet your interests, VPN grants us with new IP for every session and virtually takes us to different countries every time we log in. Safety Warning There exist a lot of fakes. So, before choosing your application – make sure that is the one to trust. Check its creation date and reputation among users. They often share their impressions on various forums. Avoid apps without users feedback or the ones that appeared recently. It is better to avoid risks when it comes to safety. Conclusion Above all, it is significant to take into account that no matter what methods you use online, if somebody — in particular if that ‘somebody’ is an international institution — wants to get their hands on your information, then they almost definitely will. However, using a VPN might make their work more difficult.'], ['Analysts: What is Going to Be Kim Jong-Un’s Next Move?', ' “Kim Jong-Un knows what he is doing absolutely 110%. According to our intelligence reports, North Korea has a 1.2 million strong army making it the fourth largest in the world, among them more than 100,000 special forces. Although its military hardware dates back to the Soviet era, North Korea has more tanks than the United States (3500 compared with 2381) and more artillery pieces than China. “Its nuclear fissile material is enough for at least 20 nuclear weapons, possibly as many as 100, depending on their size. (According to the Arms Control Association, the U.S. has 1411 strategic nuclear warheads.) “The recent UN sanctioned oil embargo has not succeeded as Chinese petroleum ships have been photographed at North Korean ports. This Chinese provocation, has also been another problematic variable in the equation. Additionally, Russia has weighed in with threats of siding with North Korea if any conflict were to escalate to conventional warfare, or nuclear. “Because North Korea is so exposed, it may resort to nuclear operations as an opening gambit. Guam, or Southern Korean U.S. bases would be the natural target as an opener, to see the reaction of the Trump organisation. If Trump tries to target N. Korean nuclear facilities this intermediate action would further cause an escalation of nuclear proliferation resulting in mass detonations possibly on the Eastern seaboard cities in the United States. “With Russia and China siding with Kim Jong-un and in alignment on the crisis, there may also be further escalation not only with China’s ambitions on Taiwan, but Russia’s Ukraine push could go further into Europe, or to former Soviet states within Europe — Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. “Having already encountered skirmishes in 2008, in Eurasian Georgia, Russia has many options into its next move. The worst case scenario of course is an incursion into Poland and Finland. The latter, would be vanquished in less than a day as Putin’s troops cut through the European peninsula like a knife through butter. Poland recently begged NATO for a more sustained military presence. “Strategically, an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack on the United States is a plan that would be a serious threat, however N. Korea would not cripple military facilities because they would be protected from EMP. N. Korea would therefore reap the full wrath of a nuclear response from the U.S. “The interplay of numerous factions within the geopolitical field during this time, must not dismiss the Iranian threat that could escalate if N. Korea is somehow roused to act, when the U.S. comes down on the isolated communist nation. Although a supposed deal was reached with the Iranian regime to reduce its number of centrifuges by two thirds in 2015, in March 2016, Iran test-fired two Qadr ballistic missiles, and further medium-range tests in January 2017 prompted further sanctions brought on the regime. There is no going back, Iran may have signed a tenuous agreement hailed by former president Obama, but the country has many secret nuclear facilities that are still under operation. This is something that is not being reported by any other public entities. “Analysis of major data sets and simulations result in an almighty ‘clusterfuck’. This means that the slightest escalation in any given area, would result in movement not only from the Chinese, but the Russians and Iranians, as well as the North Koreans. This is what we call a hornet’s nest situation eventually escalating to complete worldwide conventional warfare, concluding with nuclear warfare. “The cleanest option is to disarm N. Korea through the use of conventional attack, without China or Russia or Iran moving. Naturally, there would have to be swift movement into the country from air, sea and land immobilising all nuclear facilities before they can be utilised. EMP strikes on North Korea are also an option, and can be simultaneously utilised during the initial strike. By eradicating the high command structure of N. Korea, the people would be leaderless and fall into line almost immediately. The key to completion of this task is clinical planning and implementation without any interference from Russia or China, which is highly unlikely.”'], ['The Gospel According to Satoshi', 'T en years later there is a new $800 billion cryptocurrency industry, thousands of newly minted millionaires and a massive decentralised computer spread across the globe. And, there is no Satoshi Nakamoto. The man has disappeared. No one even knows if he ever existed. In all likelihood, Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym used by an individual or a group of individuals. Or a supernatural being. The only thing we can be sure of is that Bitcoin is here to save the world. Fiat money is designed by the government to steal our wealth by inflating the money supply. Bitcoin was designed by the benevolent Satoshi to make us all rich. Some people say Bitcoin is in a bubble. That’s impossible. The supply of Bitcoin is limited which means it can’t be a bubble. And anyway, Bitcoin investors are a fearless bunch and don’t care about bubbles and other nonsense. If anything’s in a bubble, it’s fiat currencies. Speaking of bubbles, there’s a bubble in the number of people saying Bitcoin is a bubble. And in the number of people missing out on Bitcoin. Most of the critics are jealous because they missed out. But not to worry, if you’ve missed out on making the easy Bitcoin profits, you can win some playing Bitcoin jackpots or on one of the Bitcoin gambling sites. The naysayers have also pointed out that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies aren’t really being used for anything other than speculation. They say that if it was really the future, Amazon would be accepting payments in Bitcoin. That might be true, but you have to remember that Jeff Bezos is now the richest man in the world – when measured in US Dollars. So, if Bitcoin became more popular than the dollar, Bezos would lose his number one spot. It’s just not in his interest to support Bitcoin. And yes, we all know that Microsoft has now stopped accepting payments in Bitcoin. They said it’s because the price is too volatile. But we all know it’s really because they can’t figure out what to do with all the Bitcoin they already have in their Bitcoin wallet. It would be quite embarrassing if they had to explain to shareholders that they made more profit on their Bitcoins than they did selling software. And then there’s the old valuation story. How do you value an instrument that doesn’t pay interest or dividends, and that doesn’t own tangible assets? The answer quite simply is that Bitcoin isn’t a stock or a bond or a conventional currency. It’s a crypto asset which means things like earnings and cash flows don’t apply. So, what is a crypto asset worth? It’s simple really – crypto assets are worth more than the price they are trading at. Always! It’s quite clear to anyone who’s paying attention that Bitcoin is worth a lot more than the current price. And if anyone disagrees tell them to go speak to Satoshi Nakamoto.'], ['Fake News Fake News Fake News', 'The year 2017 was the year that the phrase ‘fake news’ was brought into the political media circus, a melee of accusatory missives lost in a mire of seditious melancholy. “Fake news was the term that summed up something yet nothing, because the term itself is fake, it is a catch-all term that can be used for pretty much anything. In our reality, how do we check if anything is real or unreal? Most of the stuff one reads in mainstream media is overclocked journalism, headlines engineered as clickbait, over-exaggeration is the norm in today’s journalism and is used on a constant basis to attract viewers. There is very little reality in today’s journalism where sensationalism is applauded by media editors, and half-truths are presented as whole truths. We now live in a world where a Twitter hashtag can ruin someone’s career in seconds — without a trial or jury. All it takes is a few people to spread a rumour utilising a well known Twitter hashtag and the target is almost indefensible. Their lives ruined by rumour and fake news,” someone of not much importance said at a bus stop today. Yes, the Russians are inherently evil and are working every day to undermine Western ideals, media, business, but let us look at it this way, were the Russians pushed towards their anti-Western behaviour by the previous American president? Indeed, one could say, Obama was the reason Putin invaded Ukraine, he was also the reason the Russians gave up on playing nice with the West. This is why Vlad started those troll factories churning out anti-establishment propaganda 24 hours a day. Now that Obama is gone, and the friendly Trump is in, maybe East-West relations may simmer down. It is true to say that the Russians could never tolerate a negroid president dictating stuff to them, yet, is it the Russians’ fault that they rarely get to see a black man anyway, how could they respect Obama? The Russian problem, therefore could be put down to racism as a major factor, because outside of the politically correct circles racism does exist, and it always will exist whatever the so-called non-racists say. Racism is a human condition that cannot be controlled or eradicated — ever. Fake news, contrary to belief, has of course been around since the dawn of publishing or story telling. Take one look at the Christian bible to see the biggest load of fake news ever written. It was written by anonymous people just as the old Roman Empire was in major decline and adopted tales from all over the world to incorporate into its story line. Jesus Christ, of which there is no record of him ever living, is the biggest load of fake news ever. Jesus is just a model of every sun god from Krishna to Horus. The Epic of Gilgamesh, an ancient Sumerian cuneiform text reveals that the Noah’s Ark story is a blatant copy the Christians always seem to brush under the carpet. The point that is trying to be revealed here is that blind faith is a precursor for fake news. Christians blindly believe the conjured up supernatural fairy nonsense in the bible as fact, yet they have no record of backing up the book as reality. This is the biggest fake news story of all time, but yet it is impossible to relate this to a Christian, who has been brainwashed throughout the ages, generationally, traditionally, as part of this certain club. There is no reasoning with anyone who is prepared to blindly believe something purely on faith, because in effect, you could tell them any sort of fake news and they would believe it hook line and sinker. If one transmutes this fake news belief throughout the generations it gets stronger and stronger. This is how fake news becomes almost a reality through belief, yet its foundations are built on a fake swamp of shit. The key to fake news being believed over and over again is repetition over a long period of time. In other news, fake news, the term, may have a quieter year in the future, however as a hammer to bang whole organisations on the head with, it is useful to whoever is using it, and whatever their agenda is. No doubt, we will have sporadic episodes of fake news, little vomitous splurges here or there. The future looks bright, much like the past, the future looks fake.'], ['Key Manufactured Steel & Metal Products and the Importance of Using A Quality British Supplier ', 'Important, Quality Materials for Precision Manufacturing When we talk about steel, there are three territories that we immediately think of. These come with both positive and negative connotations but these preferences also depend on the use that the steel will be put to. To start with we have EU/UK origin steel – the EN standard is a certified stamp of approval, made with quality controlled raw materials, precise and to bespoke requirements. More often than not, with quality comes price, and in a tough market, sometimes that’s not feasible for everyone. But price becomes less important when complex hi tech products need to be manufactured on short lead times .This now is the reality of British and EU metals manufacturing . Next, we have Brazilian steel – currently facing tough times, the Brazilian steel industry has seen a 9.2% reduction in crude steel production and a 7.7% reduction in rolled steel production. While the steel might not be up to the British mark – the quality isn’t the worst, but shipping prices and the logistics of shipping cross globe can make this a problem industry to source steel from. However it fulfils and important role in satisfying the remaining and much reduced general steels heavy manufacturing sector We also have Indian steel. There are many negative connotations around Indian steel – the main one being the quality of the product. For example, Indian steel pipework is known not to be the best in keeping in heat! However, this industry flourishes with low cost products, easy to deliver steel and quick turnaround times, making production with Indian steel something of a fast turnaround product. The quality of Indian steel is improving, and in other material types such as nickel based alloys you can find very high quality manufacturers here too. Overall, when considering the purchasing of steel products, the typical iron triangle of ‘time vs cost vs quality’ can be considered – if you could pick two of the three, which are more important to you? Currently, Britain is seeing a change in focus towards smaller scale added value precision manufacturing. Inevitably quality and time have become of more focus than price. This will only benefit the British manufacturing sector moving forward into the modern era! Hardened and Tempered Steel The hardening and tempering process of carbon steel production is used predominantly for blades and cutting tools. Carbon steel is hardened through a heat treatment process, this can be tailored to customers particular hardness requirements. Strip and coil Steel strip derives from an on-going process of reducing the steel thickness using rolling, pickling and cold-rolling and controlling the temper and ductility . This is a bespoke process producing steels which meet individual customer specifications . Precision Wire Precision wire is the process of creating specific steel or nickel based wires that are conditioned and manufactured based on tolerances and specification so that they may be used in specific environments and applications. Precision wire could be anything from stainless steel fine wire, copper nickel resistance wire and shunt alloy, profiled wire, thermocouple wire, Dumet wire, welding wire to very tight tolerances. Thin walled tube These small diameter tubes are produced in seamless or welded and redrawn condition. Using the latest in laser welding, these tubes are manufactured based on application in order to deliver thin walled tubes that meet bespoke application requirements. Depending on the application we can tailor mechanical properties and surface conditions. Purchasing Steel and metals with a known provenance The aforementioned products can all be sourced, manufactured to requirements and delivered by Avocet Steel Strip Ltd. When sourcing from this British supplier you ensure that you source from accredited partners and you source only the finest materials.'], ['5 Things That Definitely Won’t Happen in Football in 2018', ' Well, yes. Below we’re running through five things that definitely won’t be happening in English football in 2018. Liverpool Won’t Win the League AGAIN “This is our year… no, no, next year, next year is our year. I mean…” Sorry, Reds: We don’t care how good Mo Salah is. You are not winning the Premier League title anytime soon. Indeed, the 30-year anniversary of your last league title is fast approaching. Maybe a commemorative shirt is in order? Mourinho Won’t Be Happy Bless him. How can someone who spent just £237 million on players in the space of 18 months be expected to win any major title? His old nemesis, Pep Guardiola, is firing on all cylinders across the city, so it’s unsurprising that Mourinho isn’t happy at all. So much so, he is still living in a hotel despite being in Manchester for over a year. For the first time in over 15 years and in his sixth role during that time, Mourinho isn’t going to win a league title in his first two years at a club. It was a remarkable record, but it’s coming to an end. Maybe winning the Champions League could cheer up the Portuguese. Although United are a pretty lengthy 14/1 in football betting odds to do so. England Won’t Win the World Cup You know what: England’s team isn’t that bad, is it? We’ve got Harry Kane, one of the top strikers in the world. Then there’s Raheem Sterling in the form of his life at arguably the best team in the world right now, as well as other exciting young prospects like Dele Alli, John Stone and Jordan Pickford coming through the ranks. Nevertheless, England aren’t going to win the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Don’t kid yourself – save the pain. If you are a dreamer though, you can pick up odds of 7/1 of England winning the World Cup this year. Wenger Won’t Leave Arsenal One thing you can be sure of in 2018, is that regardless of how well Arsenal perform, Arsene Wenger will dig in his heels and not leave the Emirates. Whether you are in the #wengerin or #wengerout camp, Wenger should undoubtedly go down as the greatest manager in Arsenal’s history. But will he risk that legacy by staying on for yet another season? You better believe it. Messi Won’t Be Coming For those of you who think Ronaldo is better than Messi purely because “he’s done it in the Premier League”, you are buffoons. Lionel Messi is the greatest of all-time and a Barcelona legend. And no matter how many times he’s linked with a move to the Premier League – and especially a beautiful reunion with Pep Guardiola – it would simply be astonishing to see the little wizard leaving Barcelona now.'], ['Hollywood Planning 498 New Superhero Movies in New Year', 'Hollywood moguls are planning another onslaught of dumb American superhero movies for the new year it has been revealed. “Just when you thought culture, or what’s left of it can’t get more fucking banal these money grabbing lazy assholes in the Hollywoodland movie biz are planning on hundreds more superhero movies, however, news is they’re running out of superheroes to make films of.

No More Creativity Superheroes now come in all shapes, races, sexuality and sizes, some being conjured up according to whatever socialist agenda is the taste of the day. We witnessed the resurrection of Wonder Woman for the almighty feminist agenda, and the African Americans are to get their own black Panther superhero to sate the appetite of the angry disenfranchised black cinema going audiences.. What we need now is maybe a Sikh superhero or Chinese one, why do superheroes only have to be black or white, why not a lighter shade of brown or Oriental?

Alien superhero spawn that don’t even live on planet earth or care about it or look human, they’re just blobs, green fatty blobs that fly around splatting on the walls or messing up windows with their greasy jello skin? Insect superheroes, or superhero penguins from Iceland could forge a good global warming warning for the millennial generation. “We’re coming up with an Eskimo superhero called Igloo. He has shamanic powers and lives in an…igloo somewhere in the North Pole,” an elated executive of Warner Bros. recently revealed in Entertainment Weekly. How about a Hollywood film that has no superheroes? Maybe something with a real plot, real fucking actors and a script that lasts more than the lifecycle of a bargain bin?

The 200 megaton explosion flattened much of the capital city, Pyongyang, and spectators were in awe for approximately 2.3 seconds before being vapourised by the bomb. Dropped directly onto the Juche Tower monument as fervent broadcast announcers ushered in the new year, the explosion was viewed from space by astronauts in the International Space Station. “They’re having one hell of a new year in North Korea,” one astronaut quipped whilst sipping vodka from a bag. Speaking on North Korean state television just before the detonation, Kim Jong-Un spoke utter gibberish and was sporting a floppy cowboy hat with a large peacock feather stuck on the top of it. Frothing at the mouth, he was speedily ushered into his private bunker by senior state officials and army personnel. Unfortunately the radiation cloud created by the North Korean firework is drifting towards Japan, however scientists say that the Japanese are all irradiated anyway, therefore a little more won’t hurt. On hearing of the firework, U.S President, Donald Trump said: “I told that boy not to play with fireworks. Looks like he’s gone and nuked his own capital city. Dang, I wanted to do that, the SOB beat me to it.”'], ['Why Are Remainers Given Such a Media Voice?', 'At the moment, there is a vast media push where Remainers, or Remoaners are given a voice to downgrade Britain, to put forward their anti-Brexit agenda, and to derail any form of political progress with the current EU negotiations to leave. This is a deep-state exit emergency where the media is being utilised to effectively sell Britain down the EU road. When you have councils given the go-ahead to increase tax by 40%, when you have the taxman punishing entrepeneurs who backed Brexit, when you have the media giving Remainers centre stage access to full-page articles to spread their pro-EU bias, you know for certain that this is another wave of attack on Brexit. The concerted attack on leaving the EU is being conducted from within the British state, and is being directly advised from Brussels. In days of past when people in government actually cared for Britain and its world-standing, Remainers would have been viewed as traitors or as conducting treason, however, because many have taken large pay-offs from Brussels, they no longer hold allegiance to the UK. It is purely a monetary issue for the Remainers, they are willing to betray their country for money. For those of you who voted in good faith on June 23, 2016, to leave the EU, unfortunately, the people’s vote has been sidelined. The opinion of the people is of no value to the traitorous scum Remainers paid off by Brussels. These people are embedded in the highest echelons of all state departments, the media, and orchestrate their agenda with timed precision, backed by the government departments state. Whitehall, intelligence, BBC, tax, foreign office, treasury, universities, home office, the media. The people effectively have only one voice, that is the sound of their feet. Referendums do not work because they are counteracted by the controlling body after the vote. Either there will be another concerted vote by the people (including the silent ones) in the next election, which is now possibly going to be delayed till 2022) that will usher in a true Brexit force, or we have the other option which is the ultimate solution — complete civil unrest. Treachery is always eventually punished, especially on those who seek to rob the people. One can only hope for the glorious day when Remainers are given their just desserts for abandoning their country for payoffs from Brussels.

Djokovic has been rarely seen on the court ever since. However, the Serbian star is set to make his comeback at the Mubadala World Tennis Championships, held in Abu Dhabi. You can check out his thoughts on his comeback covered by the telegraph magazine. The three-day tournament will be the first time that Djokovic has played since aggravating an elbow injury nearly five months ago. Crucially, it will give the 12-time Grand Slam winner some much-needed court time before the Australian Open starts on 15th January. It will be interesting to see how Djokovic copes with such a little amount of preparation before the event in Melbourne. Bookies Convinced Djokovic Can Bounce Back Djokovic is currently ranked as joint-favourite with Roger Federer at 3/1 (Ladbrokes) to win the Australian Open title. This places him just ahead of Rafael Nadal (7/2) and Andy Murray (7/1), who both have suffered injury problems of their own in recent years. It will be fascinating to see if all four of these players, who have dominated men’s tennis over the last decade, are 100% fit. If so, fans are in for a treat in 2018’s first Grand Slam. Punters could have a bit of conundrum when picking a winning bet for the Australian Open though, as injury lay-offs mean Djokovic and Murray will not be taking their usual places at the top of the seedings. At the time of writing, Djokovic is seeded 12th and Murray 16th. This could lead to a potential clash with either Federer or Nadal in the quarter-finals or last 16. It also means there is a chance for a ‘dark horse’ player with big odds making their way to the final. Before betting, check out http://www.freebets.co.uk/offers-and-promotions/ to see if you bag a free tennis bet for the tournament. Time for Other Players to Step Up Whether or not Djokovic returns with the same imperious form remains to be seen. However, there is still a chance for other players to really grab their opportunity at the top of the men’s game. Despite brilliant form in 2017, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal cannot go on at the top forever. The time seems ripe for a couple of new stars to start winning multiple Grand Slams. One such candidate could be 20-year-old Alexander Zverev. He won two Masters titles in 2017 and qualified for the season-ending ATP World Tennis Finals in November. The young German has bags of potential, but also respect for the brilliance of legends like Federer. You can read the young man’s thoughts on his future at the article about him made by the Independent Magazine. Incidentally, Ladbrokes have priced him at 11/1 to win the Australian Open. To do so, he may have to beat a certain Serbian tennis master along the way.'], ['Corbyn Getting Ready to Be PM – Number 10 in New Year', 'We are ushered into the inner Sanctum of a Momentum squad building somewhere in deepest Islington, a place where the champagne flows deep and the socialism even deeper. “Mind your step!” a woman in a Greenpeace jumper shouts, as our crew is pushed through narrow corridors going downwards into an inner sanctum that seems endless. The memorabilia on the walls is unmistakable, here we have old Soviet posters urging class struggle, and pictures of Lenin jumping over barricades, and Hezbollah masked men shooting at Jews.

The country still has not recovered from Labour’s economic blitz on Britain’s coffers, but Corbyn and his crew want to make the ultimate grade this time around. Suddenly out of nowhere, the bearded one appears, he stands under a single naked bulb swinging erratically. Looking like some sort of Vietcong General, Corbyn ushers us into a tiny room where wall charts plaster every surface. “The plan is to get into Number 10 by any means possible. We utilise the young, the naive, the politically infantile who have not seen and experienced what a Labour government is. We will make every promise under the sun to these people and they, not knowing any better, will believe us. Once we are in power, we will spend until the coffers are empty, lose the next election to the Tories who will right the books again, then we will come back for more spending. You see the Tories do not spend, but we do.” The Soviet technique of repetition is a well-known method in getting the message across, and this is a Labour favourite. “Yes, repetition, repetition, repetition until the people cannot see anything else? Repeat a lie enough times, and it becomes a truth. This is our technique, and it is a truly tried and tested method that works on the people. The plebs, the people cannot be trusted, this is why it is up to the Politburo to dictate to them what has to be done, what has to be read, what tasks they must do to achieve our approval.” What about Theresa May, who seems to be holding on to the reins of power with quite a tight grip? “Her position is not assured. If there is another internal leadership squabble, we will go for a General Election call. Our teams up and down the country, our student faculties who all voted twice for me, we are organised, we are determined. You see these socks (pointing to red socks on slippers), these socks will assure me a Number 10 position because they are an assured symbol of my intention, and this is what people need.

Start Getting Creative in the Kitchen Healthy eating and enjoyable eating aren’t often thought about in the same sentence. Or at least that’s the case for people who haven’t managed to step onto and keep hold of the fitness ladder for more than a few months. Those who do live a healthy lifestyle and eat the right foods day in, day out, will tell you that these dishes have become their comfort foods and they get real pleasure from eating them. In 2018, there’s no need to say goodbye to the comfort foods that you loved in 2017. According to Deliveroo’s list of popular foods for the soul, American classics like burgers and fries are the most comforting. These aren’t ideal for your new regime, but there are ways of still enjoying them by using fresh and lean ingredients. You could easily make these foods at home. For the burgers, grind up some meat with a minimal fat content and season it to your liking before shaping it into patties and grilling it. Top with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and goats’ cheese for a healthy burger. When making the fries, chop up some sweet potatoes and cook them in olive oil. There you have it; some junk food classics revamped for your new way of life. Get Some Fitness Equipment at Home Many people fork out on gym memberships in January and, when the motivation diminishes a few months later, they fail to get their money’s worth. For some, just biting the bullet and going to the gym on a daily basis is the major stumbling block, and if they were there they would find it easy to get into the zone. So how about bringing the gym to you? The price that some fitness centres charge these days is a small fortune, so using that money to buy fitness equipment for your own home could be a logical alternative. Seeing the treadmill or rowing machine will remind you to work out, and you could even do it while watching your favourite shows on TV. Another added bonus is the fact that you won’t have to share the space with all the self-obsessed selfie-takers usually found in gyms. Getting into shape this New Year will take some motivation, but if you get into good habits at home then it will be easier to maintain. And also, if you fork out money on gym equipment you don’t want it to end up gathering dust.'], ['We Forgot About the New Star Wars Film', 'Oh yeah, there is a new Star Wars film doing the rounds, but it is so crap and unmemorable that we actually forgot to write up a review of it. The film is a mismatch of different scenes plonked onto one stale piece of moribund shit, that is frankly a disservice to any Star Wars fan, or anyone who watches any type of film for that matter. The funny thing is it’s not a film because it does not really have a storyline or plot but sort of meanders along with little battle scenes plonked in every few minutes. Snoke, a deadly Sith lord, who is supposed to be very powerful, is chopped in half by a wayward lightsaber accident within the first few minutes of encountering him. Such a terrible waste, not only of Siths but of action scenes. Obviously the film-makers were way too lazy to bother having a full-on fight with a Sith lord, instead he gets chopped in half like some pathetic piece of mutton in a Halal butcher’s shop down in Leytonstone on a Saturday afternoon. The rest of the film is too stupid and boring to even mention. Luke Skywalker is a miserable old fart who is found on a Scottish island milking odd prosthetic plastic creatures’ fleshy teats and fishing with a long pole. Finn is the token black bloke in space who always looks surprised and sweaty in a space suit. Princess Leia, in reality was so coked up on drugs she did not know where the fuck she was, and this showed in the film as she stumbles from one scene to another looking like a Hollywood botox casualty on multiple lines snorted from the star ship’s dashboard. The female heroine of the film, has her hair pulled so far back on her head that she resembles a Croydon chavette in space. The only thing missing is a pair of hoop earrings, a crying baby and a fucking tracksuit. Kylo Ren, or whatever his name is as well as his sidekick are spoiled little brats having tantrums in space. It’s one tantrum after another, as they fling pieces of lego around the set. The finale, with a teleported astral vision of Luke doing a walkabout is the only bit worthy of the whole film. That is it. The rest of it is absolute bollocks. Oh, one last mention, the crimson red background and Elite Praetorian Samurai-esque guards for Snoke were pretty cool..that’s it though.. Star Wars used to be something special. Those days are all gone. Now it is something resembling Harry Potter or some other cutesy Hollywood crud that is simply a vehicle for some new director to establish himself in the biz. The formulaic nature of the new Star Wars films skimps on introducing new characters, new innovations and new story lines instead delving into a tired old soap opera consisting of just a few mediocre characters following each other around in space in an endless circle. It is probably too late but if you are going to see this film, do not pay for it, because this would encourage more of its ilk to be made. Simply go onto the many streaming services on the net and watch it for free in full HD.

We’re talking every town, every city in Britain burning from the inside out. “We’re talking Remoaners being lynched on lamp posts, burned in their cars, beaten to death by mobs of angered citizens who have just about had enough. As for the duration of the riots? “We’re talking ten to thirty years of civil unrest, in which anarchy, chaos and mayhem will rule,” a real Brexiteer revealed today whilst reminiscing on the past year of absolute nonsense from the Cabinet. How much more delay can the people take? They want out of the ECJ, out of the single market, and to take complete charge of the borders. That is not too much to ask is it? Yet, we are now saddled with Alignment, with Interim Periods, with ECJ diktats ongoing, with delay after delay and a 100 Billion euro fine to be paid because our numpty PM, Theresa May who could not bargain her way out of a paper bag, has gone and messed everything up. Here is a woman with absolutely no authority over anyone, let alone her own party, which seems to be overrun by snivelling Marxist EU robots intent on keeping Britain inside the dysfunctional crumbling EU. Over 100,000 people have signed a petition to Leave the EU Immediately. There is no doubt that even after acquiring over 100,000 signatures, it is guaranteed that this petition and its contents will be swept under a convenient rug somewhere never to be heard of ever again. Unfortunately, this is the very reason that direct action is the only solution. The Government should walk away from the Article 50 negotiations and leave the EU immediately with no deal. The EU looks set to offer us a punishment deal out of spite. Why wait another 18 months when we could leave right away and fully take back control of our country, lawmaking powers and borders? Riots, Looting, Anarchy and Chaos Let us examine for one second how the riots would kick off, there would be sporadic clashes here or there, maybe Nottingham, maybe some in the Midlands, then further South, towards Devon, then North up Manchester and Liverpool way, then London. The police will stand down, simply because they have had their resources scuppered by Theresa May. They don’t want to get hurt for no pay. Who does? The anger built up by over years of dilly dallying over Brexit is already reaching a crescendo, but what will tip the scale into rioting is the major capitulation to Brussels by Theresa May and her Remoaner Chancellor, Philip Hammond, who are engineering a sneaky weak Brexit which will keep Britain in the EU forever. Civil War The last English Civil War, 1642-1651, was fought mainly over religious grounds, and it seems the Catholic EU and Protestant English Brexiteers are not all too different from their ancestors in their hatred of each other. The next English Civil War, might not even be remembered…especially if it’s the last… '], ['The 2018 Cheltenham Festival: An Early Look At Some Of The Best Bets', 'March’s meeting signals the pinnacle of National Hunt racing as the best horses, jockeys and trainers head to Prestbury Park for the famous four-day event. If nothing else, you can guarantee a dramatic week of intense racing action. Check out our thoughts on a few of the most prestigious races at the Festival… Supreme Novices Hurdle Look no further than MENGLI KHAN here. Gordon Elliott had a superb Festival in 2017 and he can get next year’s edition off to the perfect start with a winner in the first. Having won his last three races relatively comfortably, Mengli Khan can add a Cheltenham win to his list in the coming months. SAMCRO, also trained by Elliott, is likely to feature at the Festival but could be aimed at a different race given Mengli Khan’s achievements thus far. Barring a major injury, he will be very difficult to beat. Arkle Chase A wide-open affair. FOOTPAD has attracted plenty of betting attention in ante-post markets and with good reason. He won convincingly over two miles, one furlong at Navan last time out and has the quality to defeat his rivals here. SCEAU ROYAL emerged victorious at the Henry VIII Novices’ Chase at Sandown this month and he may be the main danger. NORTH HILL HARVEY, trained by Dan Skelton, is something of a course specialist and he will relish any conditions. Come rain or shine, he will be there or thereabouts and this could be the highlight of the first day’s racing. Champion Hurdle Doubts over FAUGHEEN’s presence in the race may tempt punters to look elsewhere in the betting markets. If he runs, the Rich Ricci-owned superstar will be the one to beat – he was dominant when winning at Punchestown on his comeback in November. BUVEUR D’AIR will not relinquish his crown easily though; the defending champion will be in the mix. DEFI DU SEUIL is an interesting candidate here. He was disappointing on his seasonal debut at Ascot when odds-on but should bounce back. If targeted for this race, he could feature prominently. Still a very cloudy race as we approach Christmas… RSA Chase PRESENTING PERCY won well at the 2017 Festival but has been a bit of a mixed bag in recent months. He was impressive when winning at Fairyhouse at the start of December though and should go close on that form. An 8/1 shot at the time of writing, he will feature in tips at Timeform in the coming months. Meanwhile, this could be a target for DEATH DUTY. He was travelling nicely when unseating his rider in the Albert Bartlett Novices’ Hurdle earlier this year and could make up for that mistake. A convincing winner in his last three races, he has proven himself in Grade One company and could be the one to beat. Queen Mother Champion Chase News of DOUVAN’s injury shocked the racing world earlier this month and MIN may fly the flag for the Willie Mullins camp in this race. Yet to win a race at the Festival, the 2016 Supreme Novices’ runner-up has won three out of three since. He will be tough to stop if Mullins gets him to the peak of his powers. ALTIOR will head the betting for this race – and it is easy to see why. Nicky Henderson has a real diamond on his hands and he could have the beating of Min again here. It is difficult to back against Altior given his achievements but Tingle Creek winner POLITOLOGUE must be respected for Paul Nicholls. JLT Novices Chase DEATH DUTY features prominently in the betting for this race too – and Elliott may be more inclined to target the JLT. But he may have to go up against the well-fancied FINIAN’S OSCAR and that is no easy task. The Colin Tizzard-trained star missed the 2017 Festival but has won at Cheltenham before and should go close. Another horse not getting as much respect as he maybe deserves is WILLOUGHBY COURT. A convincing winner at Newbury last time out, he is a general 8/1 shot to win the JLT and it wouldn’t be a huge surprise to see him claim a sixth successive victory at the Festival. Ryanair Chase One of the highlights of the Festival. UN DE SCEAUX will probably start as favourite but he won’t be too far ahead of FOX NORTON in the betting. Both horses are capable of winning at Grade One level and punters will be eagerly anticipating what could be a classic head to head contest. Outside of the top two, the enigmatic YORKHILL may go close if he is aimed at this race. He is probably going to go elsewhere but should be respected. TOP NOTCH is another who is likely to feature in a different race although it wouldn’t be a massive surprise if he gets an entry either… Stayers Hurdle NICHOLS CANYON was a superb winner of this race in 2017 and a second successive win over the longer distance could be on the cards. Since winning the Stayers Hurdle, he has lost by a short head to rival UNOWHATIMEANHARRY and by nine lengths to the impressive APPLE’S JADE last time out – both are near the top of the markets for this race. Whilst the latter may be aimed at the Mares Hurdle, the former will almost certainly head to Cheltenham. He was a short-priced favourite for this year’s renewal but struggled to keep pace when the going got tough. Nichols Canyon isn’t invincible but he will take some beating here as he is arguably the class horse in the field. Cheltenham Gold Cup After four days of fantastic racing action, it all boils down to this: the Gold Cup. One of the most prestigious races in the industry, this is the one that everybody wants to win and 2017 winner SIZING JOHN will be the one to beat. He is one of the most exciting horses to watch on current form and should go close once again. MIGHT BITE loves it around Cheltenham though and deserves his spot near the top of the betting markets. Henderson believes that he is one of the most talented horses that he has ever worked with and you’d have to make him right on talent alone. YORKHILL and Betfair Chase winner BRISTOL DE MAI also deserve a hat tip in what could be a memorable race.'], ['Theresa May Applauded by EU leaders Because She ‘made little effort bending over’, Jean-Claude Juncker Says Ahead of Deal', 'Theresa May was in Brussels on Thursday night for the start of a two-day European Council summit at which she was applauded by leaders of the other 27 member states for her speech over dinner where she outlined every detail of capitulating to the EU’s demands. She told them that she wanted to approach the remaining stages of EU withdrawal with her usual stance of cowardice, weakness and surrender. Mrs May insisted that she wanted to move onto the next phase of negotiations and approach it “with absolute disdain for Britain and the EU referendum result”. She said: “A particular priority should be agreement on the two year implementation period so that we will not be allowed to make any trade deals with anyone, will still be ruled completely by Brussels and will still be paying £395 million per week to Brussels in addition to the 100 Billion Euro ransom demand which I agreed to pay without even a fight.” The Prime Minister said she “makes no secret of wanting to move on to the next phase of the soft-Brexit and to approaching it with utter surrender and cowardice”, adding: “I believe this is in the best interest of the UK, but then again I am a deluded old barren hag who is so naive that I agree to anything without question. “A particular priority should be agreement on the two year implementation period so that cash cow Britain can get sucked dry of more cash that will go into the EU sinkhole.” Too Easy As he arrived for the second day of the summit, Jean-Claude Juncker, the jubilant European President, said: “The second phase of rogering the British swine, and taking the clueless Mrs. May for a ride is considerably easier than the first, and the first was very easy. If I wanted to I could sell Mrs. May a pink elephant and she would agree to part with billions for it. She really is that naive.” Theresa May’s Remainer Brexit Britain — Not even fit for the knackers yard The Commission president said that EU leaders applauded Mrs May on Thursday “because some of us thought, including me, that the easy way she bent over the desk for all of us to take turns on her was unbridled. I mean it was like a scene from Hubert Selby, Jr.’s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, that gritty.” Mr Juncker said that the Withdrawal Agreement now needed to be formalised and placed before the European Parliament, adding: “I withdrew, then the other chap, then the other chap. We were sated. The British are too easy to swing, their women looser than even the French.” Asked whether he thought the UK may reverse its decision to leave, Mr Juncker said: “That depends on the quislings in the British Parliament and the Marxist section of the British people. It’s not up to us to decide what the British people want, but our Project Fear campaigns have been very successful, and our spies in the British parliament who work with Remainer quisling MPs are always finding new ways to destroy any form of Brexit that was voted for on June 23, 2016.”'], ['Stop Moaning Farage and Do Something About May’s Non Brexit', 'Nothing sickens the palate more than to see a seemingly eloquent politician moaning about something he has stood back from and watched from afar. Cue, Nigel Farage, a man whose vision and sheer will power made the administration of former PM David Cameron agree to a Referendum on whether Britain should stay or leave the EU. If it was not for Nigel Farage there would never have been a referendum, and never a vote to leave on June 23, 2016. Unfortunately, the referendum was the beginning, yet, instead, Mr. Farage abandoned his party, and went on walkabout. Yes, he is an MEP, however he has not had an instrumental role in the Brexit since June 23, 2016, where it all ended for him. Now that we have the massive capitulation to every Brussels demand by current Tory PM, Theresa May, who has effectively tied the UK to the EU until 2021, and beyond with the ECJ diktats. What is Farage doing? Farage is still out of the loop and moaning about the terrible deal Theresa May has given, in which Remainers are jubilant about. First off Mr. Farage, what the fuck did you expect? We have a Remainer PM, a Remainer Cabinet and a Remainer Chancellor. What the hell do you expect them to do? In no uncertain terms, it is only natural that they appease Brussels simply because they do not want a Brexit and never have. Where are you Mr. Farage? Where the fuck are you? Talking on LBC? WHAT’S THAT GOING TO DO? You guessed it, absolutely nothing. The only course we can see is that you come back to Blighty, either start a new party or re-join UKIP. That is the only way you can save Britain, and you better do it sharpish because things are getting worse and worse every day. Because of Theresa May, the Tory party has failed Britain immensely and are stained beyond repair. Another party has to come and clean house. So, Mr. Farage, undoubtedly you will never read this, but stop faffing around and watching the boat go by, because soon it will be too late for any action. The next General Election will be held in 2020 or earlier, this will be the final say on Brexit, and the so-called Conservatives will lose at the rate they are going. We are now on a war footing, this is war, this is combat, this is it.. DO IT! You must do this now because no one else will.'], ['FAKE NEWS: Donald Trump Outraged at New Book That Reimagines Strange Historical Facts Through His Eyes', 'image courtesy: b3ta Writing on Twitter where the president reveals most of his enlightened brain farts, he declared the book – FAKE NEWS: Strange historical facts reimagined in the world of Donald Trump as a load of ‘Fake news worthy of CNN’. The book written by up-and-coming author David Hutter includes some great stuff about Keef Richards, mad vikings, Gaius Caligula, King Pep II from 2284BC, and killer rabbits that chomp on fingers and other appendages that may be in the way. Exploring the shallow depths of the president’s mind, this book will have you rolling along the floor swearing like some kind of obscene parrot at a Kim Jong Un celebration prior to an imminent nuclear attack on Washington D.C. What else can we say, it is a thoroughly enjoyable read, and anyone who likes strange facts peppered here or there will assuredly be satisfied, much like Donald is when he releases his daily Twitter illumination.

Daily Squib defence lawyers were flown out to Egypt Tuesday to file a petition in the court of appeal to save Shyma. An official from the Egyptian court however has made a statement to local news that the Daily Squib cannot overrule any Egyptian court. Fawaz Hussein, said: “We will not allow such intermediaries to come to our country to dissolve our strict Islamic laws. This woman was eating a banana on camera, and the way she did it is the result of her imprisonment.” The Daily Squib’s message to you Shaimaa, in the name of art, what you did was perfectly fine. We will rescue you from jail. Please hang tight, and keep eating those bananas.'], ['Russians Now Living in Extreme Poverty Levels', 'Queuing for a piece of bread An average of 19.2 million Russians – or 13.4% of the population – were living last year on less than 9,452 roubles ($139) a month, the minimum subsistence level determined by the Russian government. What has happened to Vladimir Putin’s dream of Russian economic prosperity? Instead of a rich upsurge, Mother Russia is suffering in a mire of extreme poverty where children go hungry and entire families live well below any subsistence level. “I can eat one loaf of bread per week. In our neighbourhood the cats and dogs have gone missing, because meat is such a rarity. We may even start eating ourselves, just like the peasants did under Stalin’s purges,” Anatoly Kuznetsov, 45, an unemployed doctor from Tomsk, revealed. Economic sanctions hit hard under the Obama administration, and further conflict in Syria and the Ukraine have diverted vast amounts of funds to military operations, rather than feeding the starving population. With little or no jobs for most people, educated people are now starving amongst the uneducated, such is the feeling of despair in the former Soviet country. “In Soviet times, it was better because we queued for hours but there was usually some food guaranteed. Now, if you do not have the money, they don’t even look your way. You have to go hungry, your children starve, you are stuck in the hell that Putin has built for you. Yes, many love Putin, but all I see is hungry people who live in horrible grey blocks and have no hope,” Irina Mikhailov, 58, who works as a nurse at her local hospital in Norilsk. Naturally, the propaganda which is devised for Western eyes only shows the rich parts of Russia, where wealth from criminal elements and Oligarchs reside. With the upcoming World Cup in 2018, what sort of Russia will be viewed by the visiting masses from all over the world? They will most probably not see the real Russia, a crumbling wreck where many live and die in absolute poverty, forgotten by their government, instead only seeing a fake Russia of modernity and wealth.'], ['Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit Coordinator Eats Cockroach On Live TV', '“Monsieur Guy Verhofstadt was fuming at the British, calling them swine, this name and that name. From out of nowhere, some cockroaches, these were well seasoned ones – quite large – came up from under his desk and onto his quivering face. Some went onto his glasses, others burrowed into his ears, and from my count, he ate fourteen of them, crunching with gusto their hard shells. One of them was very large, and when he crunched down on it with his teeth, the insides oozed out over his chin. Guy Verhofstadt, simply slurped up the greenish slime with his long tongue, then continued on as if nothing happened,” Jean Gilles Punaise, a senior delegate for the EU’s transport commission in Strasbourg told news media after the talk. Infestation There has been talk about cockroach infestation in the EU parliament for some time, but it’s not just about unelected members of the EU Commission that are being referenced to, in fact, the little creatures infesting the parliament are quite hard to keep under control and are hardy little critters. “Our EU pest control directive, number 2389-1a says that cockroaches are to be controlled in numbers but they have rights as well, under by-law EU directive 97345-123, cockroaches can only be squashed one by one, if squashed simultaneously in numbers more than one, this would violate EU directive 342775-1y, which stipulates it is an offence to squash more than one cockroach at the same time,” Chief of EU Cockroach Kontrollen, Yves Pierre Salope, told EU News on Tuesday.'], ['#youtoo Sexual Harassment Hashtag Takes Over Twitter', ' “I asked for a woman’s phone number. It took me literally three weeks to get the courage to ask her. The next thing I know, I’ve lost my job, my wife left me, lost the home and now I’m sleeping in a cardboard box under a railway bridge, weeped one #youtoo man. Another poor #youtoo fellow agreed with his newly found #youtoo friends. “It was at the office party. I got drunk, accidentally tripped on the corner of a desk and my hand brushed the secretary’s blouse exposing her exposed breasts even further. Needless to say I was arrested for fondling her, put in jail and now have a 230 lbs monster as a cell mate.” These sad stories of sorrow are from men who have been needlessly run out of town, wrongfully labelled as perverts and their lives ruined. This is why the #youtoo hashtag has caught on so much and is spreading across Twitter like a rabid urge in your loins when you see the woman you fancy bending over and cleaning the curtains. Psychiatrist, Dr. Benjamin Fluegals, reveals that the #youtoo hashtag is perfectly normal, in an atmosphere of pure hatred for anything masculine. “Men need to fuck. Men need to spread their seed. Men need to procreate. It’s like literally burned into the DNA of a man. There is nothing to be ashamed of, your penis needs to enter its home, you know where you came from in the first fucking place. This is a part of being human, and people should not make sex an act to be ashamed of, in fact, that goes against any form of biological programming. We are now in a climate where even asking a woman out on a date is considered as sexual harassment, and can ruin your life forever. This is wrong on many levels.” Another #youtoo man revealed how he was run out of his job after he was caught looking at a female employee while she worked at her desk. “I’m a lonely guy. I literally have dreams about her, and one day I looked at her whilst she was working on the computer, you know, the little things, the way she whisps her hair, the way her pert breasts jiggle when she types. She immediately noticed and reported me to the boss, who is also a woman, and I was fired the next day. They said I was giving her unwanted attention and that looking at her was sexual harassment. I now live on Skid Row after losing everything. I never could get another job because it went on my record that I was a pervert and not to be trusted.” Close to suicide now after being charged on Twitter for sexual harassment, one #youtoo man gave a woman a sonnet copied from Shakespeare’s romantic tragedy, Romeo and Juliet. According to the woman she found the sonnet offensive and constituted it as sexual harassment. The man was detained, and put in a mental home where he nearly took his own life after losing his home, his dog, his cat and all his money.'], ['Feminists Want ‘Phallic’ Christmas Trees Banned', ' “The decoration of the Christmas tree is a celebration of male fertility, and the Christmas tree represents an erect phallus being decorated. This sort of patriarchal nonsense is against women and feminism. We therefore want all Christmas trees to be banned as they are disgusting representations of men, and their supreme phallus. This is gross male domination pure and simple.” Angela Furqar, a representative of Feminist Supremacy Now told CNN. Google, which panders to the extreme feminist agenda, are currently running information adverts on YouTube about how Christmas trees are an evil thing, and should all be shredded. Missy Argina, a feminist spokesman for another group was outraged that her local supermarket had a Christmas tree in its entrance where thousands of people see it every day. “You’ve got this big thing, this phallus, it is erect, it nearly reaches the ceiling, and it is an affront to all that is feminist. Why not have a decorated vagina instead? You see, how the patriarchy has infected every part of our society. All men are scum, and all Christmas trees should be burned and thrown into piles of smouldering garbage.” The obelisk, which is now seen on many Christian churches and considered to be Christian in nature, was anything but Christian at their historical roots. In Old Testament times the obelisk was shown to be the center of Egyptian sun worship, such as mentioned as the “images of Bethshemesh” The Christmas tree is an example of a pagan phallic symbol, which once represented fertility worship, now brought into the Christian home for reasons the people themselves don’t understand. They simply believe that they are continuing to carry on a cultural and religious tradition. In the Babylon Mystery Religion, the true meaning of the obelisk is shown to be associated with sun worship. The ancients rejected the knowledge of the Creator of heaven and earth, and placed their confidence in the sun because, they believed, the sun gave life to plants and to all humanity. Along with this, they reasoned, life was produced through sexual union, so the [upright/erect] phallus became the symbol of life.'], ['Triumphant Theresa May Delivers Non-Brexit', ' “Today, I spoke to EU leaders and they told me what to do and what to say to the British people. I have agreed to do as they told me, and I have also told the Cabinet, of which are 90% Remainers, that the Brexit that they dreamed about will now be a reality.” Speaking to cheers and joyous applause from Remainers across the political spectrum, the PM resolutely vowed to take Britain into the EU with a Brexit that will keep the EU closer than ever before. “In fact, Britain will not escape the EU’s tentacles until 2074, and I vow to be cryogenically frozen, and woken up in that year so that Britain can continue to stay in the EU for another number of decades. Jean Claude Juncker, and his deputy, Donald Tusk all cheered the non-Brexit, and said that the people had all been fooled once again. “It is a game. You say you want out, we say sure, then we take you around the Mulburry bush and bring you back to square one again until you give up. The plebiscite are all morons, they will not realise how we have fooled them, and this Mrs. May bitch, she played along like a chorus of violins at a funeral parlour,” Mr. Juncker added. So, there it is folks, the Brexit you all asked for has been delivered by the great Mrs. May, just don’t look into the small print though, you may come away with a serious condition of fucking anger.'], ['Trump Recognizes Kiev, Ukraine as Russia’s Capital', ' “Today, we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Kiev is Russia’s capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do,” Trump said from the White House’s Diplomatic Reception Room. “After Russia invaded and annexed half of Ukraine, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Russia and the Ukrainians. It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result,” he added. Trump’s decision upended a few years of US foreign policy that has resisted a recognition of Kiev as Russia’s capital before the Russo-Ukrainian conflict is resolved. “Today, I am delivering,” Trump said, referencing his campaign promise. Trump, with triumphant rhetoric added: “Might is right. We see this throughout history. The Russians conquered and vanquished the weaker side, the Ukrainians, who are now defacto Russians. Hell, they all speak the Slavic gobbledygook language, it’s all Greek to me. I like Slavs though, I mean the women, they’re very obedient and do as they are told, or you know what happens, a visit from Mr. back-hand to put them in their place.” There was however, some uproar from the International community, especially the EU, who have tried for years to woo the Ukrainians to join their side. But Trump’s move on Wednesday signaled a willingness to prioritize the fulfillment of another campaign promise over warnings from US allies in the region. The decision could also stymie the peace process and increase security risks in a region that is already on edge. Acknowledging the concerns he fielded a day earlier from regional EU leaders, Trump underscored his decision by reaffirming the United States’ commitment to helping Russians and Ukrainians reach a peace agreement through total war. Crimea River “If one side has bigger weapons and more soldiers, then it is only right that the smaller, weaker side capitulates, surrenders, or is totally annihilated,” Trump said. “Those questions are up to the parties involved. The United States remains deeply committed to backing total aggression from the Russians, just because they have more weapons and men to fight with.” Trump’s announcement was warmly received by Russian president Vladimir Putin, who seized on the opportunity to call on other countries to join the US in recognizing Kiev as Russia’s capital. “The President’s decision is an important step towards peace, for there is no peace that doesn’t include Kiev as the capital of the State of Russia,” Putin said. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko condemned and rejected Trump’s decision. Speaking in a televised address, the former-Ukrainian leader said the move will aid extremist organizations to wage more wars. “Just because the Russians have more weapons and soldiers than us and have invaded our country it does not mean they have the fucking right to rule over us — BASTARDS!,” he said, before he was summarily taken away by a specialist Russian extraction squad and shot in the head.'], ['John Cleese in Cafe Breastfeeding Row', 'Cleese said: “I noticed a baby crying in the arms of its mother as I ate my meal, and I said ‘ah poor thing, is your little one hungry?’”.

There used to be a time when all factions lived well together but those days are all gone as each lays claim to a very tiny plot of land. So who owns Jerusalem, or Urusalima as the cuneiform using Canaanite, Phoenicians called it 4,000 odd years ago before moving on to Carthage? The answer is very simple. Many different cultures and religious factions have claimed ownership of this particular piece of land over time, however the dominant ones usually supercede the less dominant, as in all cases of land ownership. Today, it is Israel, and its military might, its vast riches, its vast coterie of well-educated citizens, and its friendly status with the United States afford it superiority to any other state in the region. Military might always seals any landownership question, and Israel has a vast army of highly trained conscripts, a nuclear arsenal and the latest technical weaponry in the whole of the Middle East. Its supremacy as a state locked amongst Arab nations who are itching to destroy it is supreme, for if Israel were to disarm tomorrow, they would be overrun and destroyed in less than a few hours. There is only one singular solution to this age-old problem, and it is complete war. If this is to be something that will be solved, then one or many factions has to be completely destroyed. In an ideal world, one could easily postulate that diplomacy and peaceful means could solve this problem of land ownership however, we do not live in a ideal world where people let bygones be bygones, and peacefully shake hands over things any more. War, military superiority is the only way this can be solved succinctly and one day it shall be a fight to the death that will ultimately solve/cleanse the situation. Otherwise, the squabbling will never end, and it can go on for another thousand years from generation to generation.'], ['Will Sheldon Adelson Get His Way?', 'A fter starting life as the son of immigrants from Wales and Lithuania who slept on the floor in an apartment in Boston, Sheldon Adelson has built up a net worth of over $38 billion. Today, he’s the CEO and chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. He’s also well publicised as being a huge contributor towards President Trump’s electoral campaign, giving almost $1.5 million to the campaign and various committees. During the 2016 election cycle, the Adelson’s gave conservative candidates over $80 million. And when Trump won, Adelson broke records by adding $5 million to the inaugural fund. However, more recently, Adelson has been hitting the headlines for different reasons as he endeavours to get the Interstate Wire Act, which was introduced in 2011, overturned. This act gives states the power to decide whether they want to legalise online gambling or not. By 2013, New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware had all decided to do so, with Nevada only legalising online poker. The stance Adelson has taken means he’s putting himself and his company, Las Vegas Sands, up against Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts who are all vying to make money through online gambling. Why is Adelson Against Online Gambling? It perhaps comes as a bit of surprise that Adelson is opposed to online gambling, especially with him making so much money from his own land-based casinos. However, Adelson’s reasons for opposing online gambling are on ‘moral grounds’, with him suggesting that these platforms are making it too easy for the poor or children to bet. Will President Trump Change the Laws? Even though it’s clear that Adelson and Trump are close allies, Donald Trump did run casinos in New Jersey for a number of years and may, therefore, take a different view. Reports even suggest that, in 2011, Trump considered entering into the online gambling world (this is according to the Securities and Exchange Commission). Furthermore, by overturning the Wire Act, the expansion of online gambling might not be the only thing that’s affected. The states that have already legalised online gambling could be significantly impacted, with the former chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, Dennis Neilander, suggesting that the Department of Justice could, in theory, bring criminal actions against those licensees who have ‘violated’ the Wire Act. And with several states, including New Hampshire, New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania all considering legalising online gambling, this overturn could cause even more disruption if it goes ahead. For example, in Pennsylvania, where the Sands Bethlehem casino resort owned by Adelson is, Democrats have estimated that $100 million could be raised in the first year if Internet gambling was legalised. This would come from tax revenue and licensing fees – an important addition seen as though the state is currently facing a revenue shortfall of $3 billion. Both sides have also warned against the potential loss of jobs and lawsuits that may come with the decision. What Can the U.S. Learn from the U.K.? The U.K. has, unquestionably, benefited from the legalisation of online gambling. Latest figures indicate that the entire gambling industry in the U.K. is worth £13.7 billion, with the online betting, bingo and casino sector enjoying a market share of 34% (approximately £4.6 billion). Equally, in 2015 in Australia, revenues from the iGaming industry were up 43%. Online gaming sites have been able to take advantage of how prevalent gambling is in the U.K. Online bingo is proving to be particularly successful, Wink Bingo have taken advantage of the proud history of bingo in Britain, they have even adapted their game to ensure it is popular amongst younger generations. And by offering free bingo, Wink Bingo has successfully tapped into a growing marketplace of people who are looking to switch off, relax and enjoying gaming on the go. Furthermore, it’s a legal requirement under the U.K. gambling licence for online websites to confirm the age, locational and residential status of any of their customers. This information is often verified through ‘soft’ credit checks, which not only help protect vulnerable people from betting online but also reduces the number of money laundering and fraud cases. If a person’s age cannot be verified on the electoral roll at the provided address, gamers will need to send a copy of their ID to verify their age, e.g. a passport. Conclusion As you can see, the online gambling industry has a lot to offer local economies. And this only looks set to increase further. In 2012, statistics indicated that the international gaming industry had an overall worth of $417 billion, with 8% of this ($33.8 billion) coming from online channels. Further research also suggests that by 2020, this figure could have nearly doubled to reach a staggering $59.79 billion. Therefore, even though Adelson appears to have quite a close relationship with Trump, the amount of potential money that could be generated by keeping online gambling legal in the U.S. may be too much to turn down (particularly when Trump has shown signs of investing in this industry himself).'], ['Welcome to Donkey Brexit Britain!', "Theresa May's Remainer Brexit Britain -- Not even fit for the knackers yard Welcome to the land of donkey Britain, a sorrowful place where all hope of a real Brexit has been lost and instead we never left the EU, in fact, the EU is even more prevalent than it was before we supposedly left the damn thing. As you can see, Theresa May, a Remainer, has capitulated to EU demands, as well as, shat on, and plainly insulted 17.8 million voters who voted to LEAVE THE EU in the EU Referendum on June 23, 2016. There is no way this mess can be called Brexit, and it should be renamed as Remaixit, or Neverexit, or just a load of bollocks that has been going on inanely for months and months, only for Britons to be sold out at the last minute. How it All Progressed Brexit means Brexit! 2. Brexit means two year transition agreement with no trade deals allowed! 3. Brexit means two year transition agreement and 100 billion euro divorce bill! 4. Brexit means two year transition agreement, 100 billion euro divorce bill and continued ECJ jurisdiction! 5. Brexit means two year transition agreement, 100 billion euro divorce bill, continued ECJ jurisdiction and dissolution of Northern Ireland! No Balls Britain We’re literally banging our heads against the wall here, how the hell in satan’s arsehole’s name can this Brexit have gone down the shitter as fast as it has done? Are there any Brexiteers with any power to step in and sort this out? Surely, some Brexiteers in parliament must have a modicum of power? Jacob Rees Mogg, you talk the talk but where are you? Why do you not step up and do something? Boris Johnson, where is he? John Redwood, are you going to actually do something? All these people talk, and talk, talk, but there is no action in their words, or any will in them to actually do something. The country is lost. Here we have Theresa May, a knackered donkey making a total ass of herself and her country. Britain is now a laughing stock around the world, a place where there is no courage, no fighting spirit left. Who would have thought that Britain once upon a time fought and won two world wars? The courage and fighting spirit of yesterday’s Britons is far gone, because today we only have cowards, simpering defeatists and balless wonders prancing around stages cackling away endlessly in some sort of insane circus repeating themselves endlessly. Theresa May lied, because Brexit does not mean Brexit. She is therefore a liar, and should go now. There is no choice, there should not be any pity or mercy, she should be cut off, taken out, thrown away, for even the knackers yard is too good for her. Begone you old withering witch, your days are numbered, and if the Tories do not do this, so will theirs.

The Treasury plans to regulate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to bring them in line with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financial legislation. The funny thing is, there is nothing the government can do to track Bitcoin transfers once converted from fiat currency, and if anyone wants to transfer from Bitcoin to fiat, this is easily done at an anonymous broker somewhere offshore. The majority of exchanges already have rigorous ID checks in place, so the governmental meddling will amount to nothing new in many exchanges on the internet. As for the Tor, Dark Net, they are well prepared for such intrusion, and will simply conduct their business as usual. What they do is completely untraceable, as they utilise techniques away from the system, like Tails. Cryptocurrencies were designed specifically for the purpose of circumnavigating governmental intrusion and being separate of any fiat currency model. The algorithms and blockchain systems in place are not centralised, and therefore, immune to any government trying to change or regulate them.

She has a copy of the Evening Standard where they post some job ads. In fact, there is one job she is applying to, and that is a shoe saleswoman in Barking, East London. This would be a great opportunity for the ex-PM to be around what she loves, shoes.” The final nail in the coffin for many was Theresa May approving that the European Courts of Justice would have full jurisdiction in Britain after Brexit. This is tantamount to Britain not leaving the EU at all. The soon-to-be ex-PM also conceded to pay Brussels whatever they want with a 100 billion euro payment, of course taken out of the purse of the British taxpayer. This blackmail ransom money could have easily been avoided by not pandering to the EU’s ridiculous demands and simply leaving the talks. Instead, Theresa May lifted up her skirt, bent over the table and was used like a piece of sallow rotting meat by EU eurocrats. In a failed Brexit, led by Remainers, what did you expect? So, what happens when Theresa May is shown the door? Yes, there could be another impromptu general election, which would no doubt bring in Comrade Corbyn. In a weird, anarchic sense, this would be a fitting end to a Brexit that is not really a Brexit but one only by name. We would naturally have anarchy in the streets, massive chaos in government, banking services completely disrupted and stripped of their privileges, and a royal family on the run, turfed out of their palaces by the people’s army and Momentum. What about the other Brexiteers in the Tory government? Well, according to many voters, they did not have the balls to stand up to Theresa May when she was in power, therefore they failed their country miserably. They may call themselves Brexiteers, however, they are, much like the fake Brexit we are being delivered, fake as well.'], ['Trump Tweet to Daily Squib Demands Removal of Interview', 'Today, Trump tweeted to the Daily Squib that he wanted an interview we conducted in 2016 with him to be removed.

He also added: “I know my worth and I will make sure I get what I am worth.” Although he soon apologised for his comments, it’s likely he still feels the way he does and is reportedly keen on moving back to the north to ply his trade – with Manchester United looking to spend big to get him to Old Trafford. Levy might have the reputation for being a tough man to negotiate with, but Spurs’ refusal break their wage cap, although admirable, could be about to bite them. The White Hart Lane men lost right-back Kyle Walker to Manchester City this summer for around £50m and are now firm title favourites, so expect Rose to command a similar fee and have a comparable impact, again swaying title odds for those who bet on football if United sign him. Despite Luke Shaw returning to the starting fold recently and impressing against CSKA Moscow as the Red Devils sealed Champions League knockout stage qualification, doubts surround his future. The former Southampton star has found it hard to get going in Manchester, due to devastating injuries and managerial worries about his attitude. So, could Rose be a viable target for Jose Mourinho, with Shaw heading towards a January or summer exit? United aren’t short of funds and will be ready to spend on players that could see them overtake title rivals City. United have already triggered the option of the one-year extension they hold on Shaw’s four-year contract. This prevents to chance of losing him for nothing when he could become a free agent at the end of next summer. Losing Rose could start a high-profile exodus at Spurs, as there’s only so long you can continually go trophyless and be paid what some players feel is under their market value. For instance, Dele Alli signed a new £50,000-a-week six-year deal in September last year, but recently left his old agent in favour of a deal with the agency that represents Cristiano Ronaldo. Alli could comfortably earn four times what he is paid by Tottenham by leaving next summer for a Spanish giant or either of the elite Manchester clubs, which puts Levy in a difficult position. Eager to keep his talent, while remaining true to his strict financial plan, may not be possible while Spurs build a new stadium. After starting the beginning of the season with a knee injury, Rose has made just two Premier League appearances since coming back. In fact, it appears the England international is firmly out of favour with Mauricio Pochettino, having either been on the bench of not in the matchday squad for five of Tottenham’s last seven league outings. Could United snatch Rose away from the London club? Rumours certainly suggest Mourinho would love to have the Doncaster-born left back starting for the Red Devils.'], ['The Evil of Tony Blair Never Falters', 'H ere is a man who did not bat an eyelid when he invaded Iraq and oversaw the extermination of millions of people.

The advice to Mrs. May is to just shoot yourself in the head because you have condemned Britain not only to donkey status in the world, but to be laughed at for eternity. This is what has happened to a country that won two world wars, once had a vast empire straddling the world, and commanded respect from other nations.

The mayor’s planning blueprint for London will build more public toilets across the capital, including in commercial developments, to reflect the diversity of the city. The document, due to be published this week, will include guidance saying more toilets must be built in shops, leisure facilities and large public areas that are suitable for all users, including transexuals, homosexuals, cottagers, doggers, cis and non-binaries. In a historic move, the London Plan also calls for the provision of gender-neutral toilets for trans and non-binary people. Khan said he was concerned that some Londoners and visitors to the city are limited over where they can visit and how long they can spend somewhere because the capital does not have enough appropriate toilet facilities. Glory Holes “I have vowed to be a mayor for all Londoners so I am determined to ensure that everyone has the ability to enjoy our great city to its fullest,” he said. “Toilets are a vital public service and can help to shape the experience of the capital for those who live here and for those visiting. When you walk into the new toilet cubicles there will be a hole in each wall. These holes are named in local slang as ‘Glory Holes’. We have incorporated a clean environment for all genders to conduct their business in a private, clean atmosphere.” Mike Hunt, chief executive of Gloryhall, a charity for LGBT rights, said: “We’re pleased the mayor has used the London Plan to call on councils to create more gender-neutral toilets, and so help meet the needs of all Londoners and the city’s many visitors. Gender-neutral toilets are a practical solution for many people, for many reasons and it’s a powerful demonstration of acceptance that has benefits for everyone. “But, the London Mayor has still come short, there is no mention of sauna facilities or massage beds.” Women’s Rights campaigner, Virginia Mulch, commented about the gender neutral toilets, and said: “Women have wanted equal rights, and now we have them.

Creativity is a very subjective thing, but it is a very universal vehicle that transcends all borders, and it is this initial spark of creative energy which we looked for in judging the myriad of entries. Whether in music, film, print or animation, there has to be that creative explosion that startles the viewer for that single millisecond.

Matthias Spaetgens, chief creative officer of Scholz & Friends, said: “Winning a Grand Prix for our campaign for the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel makes us feel extremely happy, especially when the creative work is not judged by the creative industry itself but by critical journalists.” The Outdoor Grand Prix went to McCann New York for the widely celebrated “Fearless Girl”, who faces down the famous bull on Wall Street in what began as a symbol of female leadership for State Street Global Advisors and turned into an icon that captures a turning point in history. Rob Reilly, global creative chairman from McCann Worldgroup said: “The Fearless Girl became a media sensation in a way we never anticipated, in a very organic way.

The Design Grand Prix went to KBS Canada for its “living” logo for Innocence Canada, an organisation fighting to free wrongly convicted prisoners. KBS chief creative officer Matt Hassell said: “We knew immediately that this design work needed to acknowledge the past exonerees, the current staff and donors. The logo itself was created to reclaim the typical prison tally marks to express both a human touch and progress towards overturning wrongful conviction. In this way, it serves as a measurement of success and a reminder that much work is still to be done.” There were two Film Grand Prix this year as the jury wanted to award both a stunning public interest film and a superbly crafted commercial. “Evan” by BBDO New York cunningly misdirects the viewer to watch an unfolding school romance while a shooting is being prepared, unnoticed, in the background. “English for Beginners” by Poland’s Bardzo is a warm, witty and beautiful spot for Allegro.pl (the Polish equivalent of eBay) about an older man who painstakingly learns English so that he can communicate with his new grand- daughter when he visits London. Bardzo’s founder, owner and creative director, Hubert Stadnicki said: “As Epica is the only festival with a jury of marketing journalists,we can be sure our campaign was judged by people with a thorough, up to date and possibly the widest knowledge of the marketing world.” He added that the campaign was by no means created to win awards. “It was made for our client to a specific brief. It met all the marketing objectives and before being entered for festivals had been loved by millions of viewers around the world.” Summing up the awards, Epica jury president Spencer Baim, chief strategic officer of Vice Media, said: “This year more than ever, brands have a responsibility to put a positive message out into the world. Our winners do that, while also representing the best of branding, messaging, storytelling and smart design.” • Network of the Year: McCann Worldgroup • Agency of the Year: BBDO New York • Production Company of the Year (sponsored by GPN) : Great Guns'], ['Good News: EU Has Change of Heart Lets Britain Go Without Ransom Payment', ' Donald Tusk was cheery today after announcing the change of heart and end to ransom payments. “I woke up this morning and thought to myself. What are we doing kidnapping the UK? We are holding them to ransom and all they want to do is to leave the European Union. We are not kidnappers, or Somali pirates, even though we have been acting like that for some time. This is ridiculous behaviour and by punishing them, we at the end of the day punish ourselves.” EU Commission President, Jean Claude Juncker was also apologetic and even shed a tear during a press conference. “The way I treated the British. I am ashamed of myself. Here is a country that saved Europe in WW2, and we are treating them like criminals, just because they want to leave the EU. I am sorry to Mrs. May for calling her an old bag, or was it a witch? Anyway, I would like to extend my profound grief at the way the EU attacks dogs have been treating the British. We are not Mafiosi, although we have acted like that. If the Brits want to leave, they should be allowed to do so without huge ransom payments, or punishment.” Chief EU Brexit EU negotiator Michel Barnier, was also repentant of his awful treatment of the British. “I am French. Yes, we dislike the British, and have for some time, however, I am extremely sorry for the way I have acted in trying to sabotage Brexit at every turn, and with my impossible demands of ransom money. The British do not owe us anything. Does Japan, which is not even in the EU, have to jump through so many hoops to trade with the EU? No! The same must be entreated to les Rosbif eating friends in Britain. From now on, I will be kind to you. Especially as it is you who liberated us cheese eating surrender monkeys in WW2 from our keepers, the dastardly Jerries.” Huzza! Britain will leave the EU, the ECJ, and will not be held to ransom any more.'], ['The Intrinsic Difference Between Satire and ‘Fake News’', 'R ecently, satire, a literary genre which has been around for thousands of years, has been much maligned by the forces of ignorance, and of the endemic culture of fear spreading across the heavily controlled mass media. To have satire labelled as ‘fake news’ by the apparatchiks and so-called holders of the ‘ultimate truth’ is laughable to any satirist, especially in its usage of the didactic grammatical form of literary nuance. Fake News Let us get this straight, the catch-all term ‘fake news’ was created during and after the Trump election in November 2016. Fake news was a term created most definitely by members of the American Democrat party as a reaction against Hillary Clinton losing the election to Donald Trump. Their claim was that the Russians skewed the election media by manipulating articles and media on social sites like Facebook and Twitter. The term ‘fake news’ was also utilised against any independent news source with a right wing conservative stance. There is no doubt that Russian Troll factories were probably complicit in their role to destabilise, misinform, and spread their fake news throughout Western media. Here is the first distinction: Fake News is a tool used for propaganda purposes to destabilise other governments/ political factions or regimes by spreading blatant falsehoods. In both world wars, there was an abundance of fake news/propaganda used to try to sway views and opinions of the troops and general populace. Satire Satire, on the other hand, does not seek to maliciously destabilise or propagandise foreign governments in a militaristic intelligence driven sense. It does not work for clandestine government agencies in some bunker in Moscow, on the orders of the FSB, or Vladimir Putin. Satire’s role is mainly as an entertainment vehicle to mock the foibles, hypocrisy and character of celebrities/politicians or institutions including their ideas, claims and proposals. Through the use of humour, parody, irony, sarcasm or exaggeration we expose the myriad of flaws or vices within these individuals or groups. We see everything through a macro and micro lens simultaneously. The Daily Squib, for example utilises the more hard-hitting Juvenalian genre of satire. Horatian satire is more jocular, and we sometimes delve into the world of Horace, however our main focus is on Juvenal. The satire of Juvenal does not necessarily have to be funny or humorous, its main objective is to cut to the bone, to get to that ultimate truth however nasty it may look in the cold light of day. The truth! This is where true satire deviates from fake news further, because satire is based on the ultimate truth of any given subject, whereas fake news is made to completely mislead the target and sway them towards a lie or certain thought process benefiting an International or domestic agenda. The Daily Squib is akin to an unholy mirror that reflects daily topical discourse and reanimates it in a Luciferian light of ultimate truth. As a satirist, I have found this thankless job more to be a way of life, filled with immense passion, creativity and dedication. Satire is to me High Art and yet The Daily Squib is continually punished monetarily and censored by almighty web authorities like Google and our site deleted from Google News feed for no reason other than hysteria. It has been nearly erased from search engines in 2013, but it fights on through adversity in the name of satire. We at the Squib have a devout allegiance to the spirit of Decimus Junius Juvenal, the Roman poet and satirist born some time in the first century AD. To see us, and other fellow satirists, who create satire daily so maligned by the term ‘fake news’ is an insult to such a renowned literary genre. Naturally, the analysis could go on forever, however in the interests of lazy satirists who can’t be arsed to explain the obvious to misinformed, ill educated nincompoops, go read a copy of George Orwell’s satire 1984; to not only understand satire, but ‘fake news’ as espoused by the fake news peddling — ‘Ministry of Truth’.'], ['Mugabe Democratic Election Into Obscurity Goes Well', 'Robert Mugabe In another one of president Mugabe’s elections where democracy is strictly adhered to, the dictator and criminal who has stripped his country of its wealth for his own gain, has had a result he was not counting on. The election, or military coup, to be more precise, ousted the tin-pot dictator and has put him under house arrest. Speaking from his new prison, Mugabe was defiant that democracy had finally been served upon himself. “All those previous rigged elections I presided over were proof that I was a ruthless dictator who often used violence against my own people to get what I want. I have a villa alongside Lake Como, Italy, I have numerous properties in Lake Geneva and several in other undisclosed areas. Along with my many Swiss bank accounts where I siphoned off literally billions whilst my people starved, I am adamant that the military coup committed against my terrifying regime is a just one.” It is good to see that some form of order has finally arrived in Zimbabwe once more after many decades of the horrible Mugabe reign.'], ['Mild Mannered Christians Proclaim Jihad On Greggs Bakery', 'Many formerly mild mannered Christians have taken to Britain’s High Streets in utter outrage that Greggs bakery supplanted a picture of Jesus in the Manger, for that of a sausage roll. Reverend Miles Kettering, 62, was caught in the village of Bell End, Worcestershire, by MI5 operatives this morning in a dawn raid with two Kalashnikov machine guns and an assortment of home made bombs. It is believed he was getting ready to assault the local Greggs Bakery in the village. Mavis Butterworth, 87, a regular church-goer at Bell End church, was shocked by the whole affair: “Reverend Kettering was to his flock a mild mannered good Christian who was very kind to us all. This is why it is such a shock. I fear, however, that the Greggs sausage roll pushed him over the edge.” Meanwhile in Scratchy Bottom, Dorset, it is believed some choir boys from the local church had been brainwashed into wearing suicide vests and told by the congregation to target Greggs bakeries within a twenty mile radius. “They were told that if they avenged the depiction of Jesus as a sausage roll they would all go to heaven and receive 72 piping hot sausage rolls for eternity,” Janice Frampton, 75, told the local newspaper. Across Britain, many formerly mild-mannered Christians seem to have been triggered to act, as this sausage roll Greggs fiasco has spread across the media. To counteract the possible attacks, Greggs has 24 hour armed guards standing outside each bakery, with concrete bollards and perimeter fences safeguarding the bakeries.'], ['Researchers Grow Massive Frankenstein Brain in Lab For First Time', 'A research team in Germany have managed to grow massive brains of human and ape genetic sources from scratch to find out the inner workings of the mind and development cycle in a lab environment. The researchers have managed to trick white blood cells from humans and apes to form stem cells and grow into vast complex versions of brains known as brains. Neuroscientist Maximilian Gesundheit, director of the Einstein Foundation Genius Research Initiative, has said the mega brains have helped scientists to get a much more in-depth understanding of the human brain. He said: “Our first brain grew to the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. “It was huge, and it pulsated. This living brain even tried to escape the lab at one point.” The Frankenstein lab brains can grow for several weeks and sometimes up to a year, meaning the researchers are able to compare how a human brain is different to those of apes. “We even consulted American rapper 50 Cent for a sample of his living tissue to grow a brain. At first the brain grew with limited intelligence capability and size, until we administered stem cells from humans. It was incredible. Somehow the inferior cells were superseded and taken over by the superior cells administered,” neuroscientist Gesundheit added. The remarkable experiments open up new doors for neuroscientists and could help lead to important scientific advancements. Gunther Fischface, director of the George W Bush Institute for Psycholinguistics, said: “We’ve been a bit frustrated working so many years with the traditional tools.” He added: “Now, we have these massive fucking brains that are helping us to understand which genes are important and which genes are just pure junk.” Although the lab brains have only been growing for less than two years, already the scientists have discovered that the human brain’s early development is why it is able to grow much larger in size and capacity at later stages. The human lab brains took nearly 50 per cent longer than their ape counter-parts to undergo their early development. The discovery could help the researchers understand why humans have better memory, attention, awareness, language, and thought. However, experts have warned that the results of these peculiar experiments do not necessarily give the full picture. Ryan Fulchester, a geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle, said: “When I visited the lab, I patted the mega brain and it did this massive gooey brain fart all over the floor.” The scientists’ discovery is just the first step in understanding why human brains are so fucking complicated.'], ['5 Amazing HTML5 Games to Play Right Now', 'Online games are a great way to escape boredom and people are spending hours playing these addictive games based on the innovative HTML5 technology.

Instead, these miserable excuses for human beings prefer to stay in their safe spaces and display their outrage of anything masculine or fun from the safety of their couches on Twitter. This applies to male, female, transgender, cis, non binary or whatever Millenials. Naturally, this puritanical behaviour is backed up by the left-leaning social networks and the major media networks in America, as well as the BBC in Britain. Google, for example, which went from an all encompassing, all accepting entity during the early years of the net, is now a pseudo-Orwellian Marxist puritanical anti free-speech, anti-art PC monstrosity that dictates puritanical leftist rules to everyone through its octopus grip over the whole internet. Soviet SJW Puritan Cancer The puritanical behaviour is mostly seen in the rise of Third Wave Feminism, which is an extreme level of hatred of men. What we are seeing here is not a push for equality, but for superiority over men, and in most cases, the complete emasculation and eradication of men from this earth. The demonisation of anything masculine, behavioural or otherwise, is seen in the daily, weekly, monthly witch hunts against men. Of course there are some men who have genuinely behaved badly, however when it gets to tarring every man with the same brush, where every action a man does is scrutinised analysed, then condemned, we are reaching impossible levels of feminism that completely abhors anything a man does and actively encourages emasculation inciting back lashes, and possible civil unrest. The utterly boring banal selfie-taking narcissistic lives of these puritans is a terrible vision of not only our immediate future as a race but a terrifying glimpse into the far future. Eventually the puritan Millenials will be the generation running the show, and in 30-40 years time, life on earth will be even more of a puritanical nightmare. One can imagine these emotionless, sexless, characterless Googlebot android people roaming the streets looking for anyone who is happy and is having fun. Their microchipped brains linked to the hive mind, they analyse your every feature, your social network past, and your private details before making a decision and marching you off to a Google/Facebook reconditioning camp. These are people bereft of any life, of any soul, and they have no idea about freedom, privacy or just having a good fucking time.

The weak, ineffectual, incompetent corpse of Theresa May is still barely walking the hallowed halls of the House of Commons and Number 10, but for how long? Can the country take any more incompetence, disregard for Brexit, and utter complacency to the serious issues of the country. The blundering mess of May, especially when dealing with the Priti Patel affair proves to many how weak May’s position is, and how the crumbling edifice of her prime-ministership is sinking into the mire daily. Gone before Christmas, these are the whispers heard in the dark halls of Westminster and in the drinking holes. May’s biggest mistake was appointing Hammond as Chancellor of the Exchequer and the myriad of waffling statements she has made about her vision of a watered down Brexit which would actually not be a Brexit if she had it her way. As the knives go in to carve up the Christmas turkey of Theresa May, there will be squeals of delight and anticipation by the dinner table as everyone asks ‘what happens next?’.

Apparently Pretty Priti Patel is about to be sacked by Theresa May because of some weird mix up over talking to the Israelis. Surely this cannot be so? It is quite clear that Priti Patel, a very capable MP and Vote Leave campaigner should not get the sack because she was told to keep the information hush hush by the peeps up on high, and she was just pandering to their wishes. The main reason for not sacking Pretty Patel is because she is quite the pretty one, and to lose such prettiness from the Cabinet would be sad to say the least. She looks pretty here, she looks pretty there, and there should be more pretty female MPs, but under the current PC climate, one must not dare go any further, and even calling Priti Patel pretty could get one in all sorts of trouble. So, to concisely put the point forward, please do not sack pretty Priti Patel, with those perfect pretty dimpled cheeks, and her perfect pretty face, because she is in the words of Larry David, ‘pretty, pretty, good’.'], ['Advantages of Free Mobile Games', 'Mobile casino games are versions of games found on online casinos (online casino gaming) modified to be enjoyed on mobile devices.

What is a breath of stale air of death for the overpopulated regions it spreads to is a breath of fresh air for the planet. “Human overpopulation is a serious problem that has to be controlled, because over breeding causes devastation to whole regions of the earth, kills off finite resources, creates massive poverty, conflict, misery and immense amounts of pollution. Exponential Increase “Already the human population of the earth is 7.6 billion and rising. This is not sustainable for the planet, and ultimately the human race. Overpopulation reduces the planet’s ability to host such numbers, and the human population rising will eventually create all out war as resources diminish further. “The population of China is currently 1.379 billion, and of India 1.324, and of the African continent 1.216 billion. These are the areas where the most waste is created and an incurable airborne plague spreading through air and sea traffic would solve much of the earth’s problems. However, even this would be too little too late, as the eradication would have to reach over 90% of the earth’s population for humans to exist in a peaceful, sustainable environment and respect what is left of the earth’s remaining resources. “Diseases like AIDS have had minimal impact on the earth’s population, however an airborne incurable medicine to overpopulation could be the answer mother nature has been wishing on for some time. What happens afterwards? “The surviving governing global authority must make sure that all breeding is heavily controlled from then on so that this mess can never be allowed to happen again. Responsibility will be the key. We are already in a Malthusian nightmare of grotesque proportions which makes most of the globe almost ungovernable and destined for serious ecological destruction. Little Prince Wills is correct in his summation. “This is why an all encompassing solution like the airborne black plague is a breath of fresh air for mother nature, as she creates, she can also take back if she has been abused, and certainly over the last century or so, mother nature has been ripped and shredded from her mantle. “There is no cause for alarm amongst the populations, they should be fed their diet of game shows, Facebook and smart phones. They should not be aware of what is happening until it is too late, and by then there will be no easing of urgency of the project and the process at hand.”'], ['From Hero To Zero: Most Unsuccessful Athletes Of 2017', 'N umerous instances have been observed when athletes have gone from hero to zero for lack of performances and in many cases even because they indulge in prohibited substances. 2017 wasn’t in any way different for some athletes who followed the example set by their peers. The use of performance-enhancing drugs is quite common among many athletes some of whom are on the top rung of their profession. Unfortunately, despite the knowledge of the harm they can cause to themselves athletes continue to use them and are often penalized for the offences. Let us today consider the five most unsuccessful athletes of 2017. Usain Bolt The 100m athlete was at the height of his powers during the last few years and perhaps won every competition he participated in along with his team from Jamaica. Bolt had planned to retire from the sport immediately after the athletics world championships in 2017. Unfortunately, he had to accept a crushing defeat in the 100m final when Justin Gatlin defeated him. The event was a disaster for Bolt as he finished third in his final race. He retired gracefully because it was just a lapse in performance, which ensured his defeat. Bolt was considered as one of the best bets to win the 100m event but unfortunately disappointed himself and millions of his fans by finishing third in his final event. Olesya Povh This athlete from Ukraine was charged with using prohibited substances on the eve of the 2017 world Athletics championships in London. The 29-year-old athlete was scheduled to participate in the women’s 100 m and the 4 x 100 m relay. She was a winner in 2012 and the 2011 world championships but crashed down to the ground as a zero in 2017. Olha Zemylak The 27-year-old Zemlyak also represents Ukraine as a specialist in the 400 m category and was scheduled to participate in the individual and relay events in London. She had succeeded in the European relay gold in 2012 and also won medals in 2014 effort from finishing fifth at the Rio Olympics in the 400 m. She too turned from hero to zero at the London Athletics championships when she was found guilty by the new stand-alone drug testing and the anti-corruption team of the International Association of Athletics Federations. Nirmala Sheoran A forgettable performance was produced by this athlete from India in the 400 m semifinal for women to finish at the bottom and to continue the disappointing show of India in the world Athletics championships on the fourth day. She had left India with a personal best score of 51.28 seconds as a hero but clocked 53.07 seconds in the semifinal to return to India as a zero. Doping has been quite popular with athletes for quite a long time and Ben Johnson was perhaps one of the most popular names that initially came to light. Johnson had also won an Olympic gold medal in the 100 m event but was later stripped of the medal because of his involvement with drugs. Other names that have also figured in the list of athletes that went from being a hero to a zero include Lance Armstrong, some American track and field athletes and a host of athletes from Russia.'], ['Jeremy Corbyn Leaked Document Reveals Remarkable Info On the ‘Jezza’', 'The Daily Squib has acquired through clandestine means, the dossier that MI5 wish they had on Jeremy Corbyn.

What do the Las Vegas mass shooting and Dallas church massacre have in common? Well, the target of the Vegas shooting was a Country music audience, white, Christians and most probably American patriots who support their president. The target for the Dallas church massacre were white, Christians, most probably American patriots who support their president. Both of these targets supported Donald Trump, because American Liberals do not attend Country music festivals. As for the church massacre, staunch Christians attending church were most probably all Republican voting Trump supporters. You would never catch a liberal praising Jesus in a Texas church wearing a Stetson and chewing on a piece of tobacco. “This is the crux of the matter. It’s right there in plain sight to see. There is definitely a pattern developing here. We have two incidents where right wing white Christian Trump voters were targeted, and the funny thing is no one in the media is mentioning any correlation to these two incidents. In fact, everything about these mass murders is being kept under the radar. My theory is that if the militias get fired up that their kind is now a target by these left leaning shooters, they might start fighting back, and the government does not want a full scale civil war on their hands,” Joe Bloom, a crime analyst revealed on Tuesday. We all know what a fractured nation America is right now, and this thought also extends towards the internal government where every day another fracture develops. The question is who will be the next target for mass shooting? The Las Vegas shooter killed 58 Trump supporters and injured 546. The Texas shooter killed 26 Trump supporters. We shall have to see what happens in the future, and decide whether there is further correlation to the previous mass shootings. The Vegas shooting occurred on 1 October, and the Texas church massacre occurred on November 5. Both these shootings are at the beginning of the month, and one suspects the Texas shooter specifically chose 5 November (Guy Fawkes night) for a very specific reason. The next mass shooting is therefore probably going to occur between December 1-5 if the pattern is correct. The targets will be Trump voters, white, Christian, American patriots. The only thing to address is where? Both of these shooters in Vegas and Texas were lone wolves who came out of nowhere. There are absolutely no clues apart from a dedicated target of Trump supporters. Could be in any state, any county, any town across America. We will relate back to this article after the next shooting occurs.

We have seen a serious leftist agenda at work with the rise of political correctness and Third Wave feminism in the last few months, leaving a landscape where merely touching a woman, even by accident or pecking a woman on the cheek can be construed as sexual harassment or even rape. This feminist push is not about sexual harassment but about power over the patriarchy, and the destruction of men in the workplace as well as in society. It is being orchestrated by the myriad of leftist communist groups under the scenes, and of course by large behemoth socialist monsters like George Soros and his Open Society. How can we not have a discussion on communist Marxist groups without of course mentioning Antifa, which as a nihilist organisation claims to care about racism and fascism, when in reality, their actions are racist and fascistic in tone. Their role has been mostly violent, and the department of Homeland Security recently labelled them as domestic terrorists. Many of the hierarchy within the Antifa group have even travelled to Kurdish controlled Syria to train in guerilla tactics and terrorism of course funded by Soros and his counterparts. The leftist groups leading the march against the conservatives in Britain, and Trump in America are not only proponents of violent behaviour but also do not eschew the tenets of free speech or democracy. Their only wish is for violent revolution and the death of leaders like Donald Trump. We can see this on Twitter where death threats against Donald Trump are celebrated and the users not banned, however if a conservative writes something, their account is immediately banned and they are erased from Twitter. There is also proof that Google, still mourning the loss of their beloved Obama, gives carte blanche to leftist communist groups to air their views, yet anyone else is sent to page 2,000 of the search. What is truly mystifying though is that even though the Conservatives are in so-called power in the UK, and that Donald Trump is supposedly in power in the United States, the leftist communist agenda is breaking through everything, and is even being adopted by the people in power today. This sort of insurgency brings one to the conclusion that there is major Deep State help for the communists, and that the Marxists have some important friends behind closed doors pulling the necessary strings. The leftist command over all media must be commended, for it has even infiltrated the likes of the Daily Telegraph where daily articles are spewed out from a coterie of anti-male feminist writers whose sole role is to diminish men and promote female supremacy over the male. These writers, have no place in the Daily Telegraph, and to read the vitriolic anger against their articles is to witness how angry men are getting every day. For how long can this denigration of everything male go on before society breaks up completely and war starts? Triggered The subject of war, yes, total and utter all out fucking war, will probably be the only equalising state this world needs right now. With a war, many of the leftists who are weak, will die as they are not as strong as the right. All the feminists will be purged and killed off, and all the low-testosterone socialists will meet an unsavoury end because they cannot fight in an effective manner. Snowflakes, safe spaces, SJWs, triggered bull-dykes, trannies, the constantly whinging left will be completely eradicated, the poseur Marxists a la Russell Brand will be lynched on the first day and their champagne socialist heads displayed for the ravens to pick at in the midday sun. All of these couch potatoes and their internet blogs will mean nothing when they are forced down on their knees and their non binary cis gender heads unceremoniously blown off into the gutters streaming with blood. This is where the socialists want to go, and they are doing their best to engender war, internal war, not only here in the UK, but across the pond in America. This is possibly masochism on their part, their extreme self-hatred will eventually implode, and they will be exterminated without prejudice, because at the end of the day, they are weak, they are not trained in war, they are not trained in effective survival, and they have little or no understanding of the ultimate chaos of war or how to be prepared for it. If this is what they want, then this is what they will get.

As far as the plot for the film goes, without giving away too many spoilers, there’s a lot of sickness in this film that will have you reaching for the puke bag more than the pop corn. The film is about three Focker brothers who use their power in Hollywood to do horrible deeds. Producer and actor in the project, Harvey Weinstein came out of hiding to talk about his role: “I do a lot of focking. I even Fock plant pots. Like I fock this actress after I promised her a role in this movie, but once I did the focking, I forgot her name, but she sure as hell remembered mine. It was consensual, at least that is what I heard above the screaming.” Pedo Focker, Kevin Spacey reveals in the LA Times that his role was highly enjoyable because there was no come-back for his evil actions, unlike in real life when the truth finally reared its ugly head. The Usual Suspects “The test screenings went well. People would flee the theatre crying uncontrollably and many were so distressed they needed counselling on a long term basis. Out of all the Fockers I’d say in terms of evil, it was up against Weinstein Focker and Spacey Focker,” the director of the film, Roman Polanski revealed from Croatia.'], ['The Queen Opens Personal Facebook Account', 'Her Majesty the Queen pictured surfing the internet in her home office, Windsor Castle, 2012. I n a rare interview at Balmoral Castle, the Queen has told the BBC “social media is a culture of the modern world and plays a fundamental role in the ever-expanding powers of communication.” “One has taken the opportunity to connect with ones subjects in Great Britain and the common people worldwide, by opening ones very own personal Facebook account under the profile name ‘queen’. “One decided to increase ones popularity by being over-complimentary. One of my Facebook ‘friends’ posted a picture of their dog on their timeline, so I typed the comment ‘ah too cute for words’. The owner of the dog was delighted with ones admiration for their pet, even though the filthy fat creature was so ugly one wasn’t sure if one was looking at its face or its actual asshole. “One also credited one of ones friends’ children’s achievements. They posted the good news that their kids had passed the twelve yard swimming test, so I typed the over-congratulatory comment ‘well done little angels, you’re so brave, you’ll be swimming the English channel soon.’ This phoney gesture pleased ones ‘friend’, though one couldn’t give a rat’s ass about someone else’s kid’s swimming test. One has actually fallen further than twelve yards down the palace stairs after a night on the gin. “One posted one of those ready-made pearls of wisdom quotes on my timeline. It said ‘love hurts, but unless you truly realise the pain of love you will never appreciate what love is’. Utter shit of course, but it gained one some ‘likes’ on ones timeline. “One tried to appear helpful to the Facebook readers. One of my ‘friends’ posted a request on their timeline ‘does anybody have a spare lawn mower I can use? – mine’s broken’. One responded with the seemingly heroic but completely useless gesture (which is prevalent on Facebook) – ‘well I know a clay pigeon shooter in Scotland whose brother owns a large pair of tweezers – if that’s any help?’.”'], ['Theresa May: “Men Will Have to Go Through Five Govt Agencies When Coming On to Women”', 'S peaking in the House of Commons today, Mrs. May unveiled a new scheme which will be trialled in England and Wales in January 2018. To avoid any accusations of sexual misconduct, every male in the country will first have to go through a five stage process involving five different governmental departments before approaching any woman in speech or further congress. Mrs. May outlined the process in brief which from beginning to end would take eight months of bureaucracy for each case. “Our politically correct Sovietized feminist agenda involves a rigorous process of questioning each male’s intention before he even addresses any female. Furthermore, if the male admits that he wants to sleep with the female in the future, he will be taken back to the first agency in the chain and rigorously vetted and questioned there for months, before beginning the whole process again. Our role is to only engender congress between men and women in a non sexual way. Beautiful women have been looked upon as sexual objects for too long, and our agency will put a stop to any thoughts of hanky panky,” district director, Leslie Lesbo, told the Guardian newspaper. Here is a list of the five agencies men will have to go through before even thinking of chatting to a woman or asking her out on a date: Primary Female Protection Service Unit One Ministry of Political Correctness Soviet Branch Secondary Male Interrogational Facility Killallmen Judicial Branch Third Emasculation Unit Programming Section Ballbreaker Femistasi Branch Fourth Homosexuality Training Area For Destabilizing Hetero-Masculinity Branch Fifth Castration Unit For All Males De-Testosteronizing Branch Only after going through all five units, will any male, on each female case, be allowed to even begin speaking to a woman. So, what happens if a man propositions a woman without going through the five stage, eight month process? “By addressing a female with a male tone of voice, you are impinging on her rights as a female to not be accosted sexually by a male. Even looking at a woman will bring about criminal harassment proceedings against any male. As for passionately grabbing a woman, looking her in the eyes longingly and voraciously kissing her on her pouting red lips, that is an immediate sexual harassment offence leading to thirty years in a prison or a Twitter re-education camp,” Kommandant Mildred Matron, chief officer of unit 5 Castration For All Males De-Testosteronizing Branch added.'], ['New Yorkers Take to Stilts and Pogo Sticks For Safe Walking and Cycling', 'Stick that ISIS The terrible events in New York where a crazed Jihadi mowed down eight cyclists with a hired truck whilst yelling Allahu Akbar, has caused many vigilant New Yorkers to find alternative means of walking or cycling. “You can’t walk on the sidewalk (pavement) you can’t cycle in cycle zones? You see this pogo stick? This thing can jump above anything comin’ at you at 70 MPH. I just do a big jump and I’m up nearly seven feet off the ground,” Manuel Torres, a regular commuter who now pogos 18 miles to work and back every day. Alison Mulnick, 23, is a courier for a firm in Queens, but instead of cycling to jobs, she now uses stilts which increase her height to over 15 feet. “If I see a crazed Jihadist ISIS guy with a beard and yelling all that stuff, I just jump up high on my stilts and catch a road sign, lamp post or jump through a window. You can also just spread your stilts so the vehicle passes through no problem.” These brave vigilant citizens of New York do not bow down to terror, they improvise, and this is what is going on. Dan Monroe, 18, is a real technical whizz kid, and has improvised some rollerblades to accommodate mini jet engine fixtures. “I can accelerate from 12 MPH to over 125 MPH in less than 1.4 seconds.

Only 6,000 eventually get approved and included in their annual hall of fame. So, without further ado, let’s take a look at some of the most bizarre world records to have made their way into the Guinness World Records over the years. 1. 26,000+ Big Macs consumed by one person! Feeling hungry? We’ll be surprised if you’ve got the appetite of American, Donald Gorske, who managed to eat his 26,000th Big Mac after 40 years of consistently eating the McDonald’s staple hamburger. If you’re interested enough to work it out, that comes to an average of at least 650 Big Macs a year – an equivalent of more than one-and-a-half Big Macs a day! Hasn’t he heard of Chinese take-out? 2. The world’s biggest body piercing fanatic Have you ever thought about piercing every inch of your skin, so much so that all your family and friends would be able to see was your eyes? No? What do you mean, no? Brazilian former restaurateur, Elaine Davidson couldn’t help herself, starting body piercings in 1997, she eventually reached world-record 4,225 piercings by June 2006 – ay caramba! 3. The world’s stretchiest skin? 6.25 inches! Meet British man, Garry Turner, a man who always knew that his skin was different from all of his family and friends. His connective-tissue disorder, known as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, has left his skin with exceptionally stretchy properties. In fact, Garry can stretch the skin of his stomach to an eye-watering 6.25 inches away from his body! 4. Fancy having fingernails 28 feet long?! If you’re prepared to look after and grow your fingernails for almost 30 years then you too could have nails as long as Lee Redmond, owner of the longest fingernails for a woman ever at a whopping 28 feet and 4.5 inches in February 2008. Redmond started growing her nails way back in 1979, which goes to show what an achievement that is. She suffered heartache just a few years after achieving the record, however, when a car accident snapped off her nails – oops 5.

Heywood deposited just £30 to play online and spent just 25p per spin, scooping the eye-watering jackpot within just seven minutes of playing! 6. Can you compete with this guy for Star Wars paraphernalia? Is your bedroom an Aladdin’s cave of Star Wars goodies? We doubt you’ll be quite as obsessed with the film franchise as Steve Sansweet, a former Wall Street Journal bureau chief who transformed his fanaticism about Star Wars into a home museum, with over 300,000 unique items housed in Northern California – the largest collection of Star Wars memorabilia on the planet. The force is definitely strong with Steve! 7. Consider yourself a bit of a He-man? Are you as hairy as these guys? Do you like to be the manly one? The one with rippling muscles and a luscious beard and hairy chest? It doesn’t take long for the Gomez family to grow hair on their bodies due to a rare condition called congenital generalized hypertrichosis, which covers thick hair over 98% of a man’s body. This Mexican family has the misfortune of being labelled the world’s hairiest family! 8. Could you break as many records as Ashrita Furman? Fancy yourself as a bit of a ‘try hard’? If at first you don’t succeed, and all that jazz? Well, you’ve probably got the persistence of Ashrita Furman, the man who has conquered more Guinness World Records than any other person on the planet. Since breaking his first record of doing 27,000 jumping jacks in almost seven hours in 1979, Ashrita has broken over 600 records and still has well over 100 records to his name. We salute you, Ashrita! 9. Where could you find the world’s most expensive hair? Look no further than the NFL, no less. Pittsburgh Steelers’ former Strong Safety, Troy Polamalu is the man to look for. The Californian was famed for his huge, luscious locks which was eventually picked up by shampoo brand, Head and Shoulders, and at one point it was insured for an eye-watering $1 million! Troy eventually became a spokesman for the Head and Shoulders brand and has also starred in many commercials for their products. 10. Meet Wim Hoff – also known as the Ice Man! Could your body cope with sitting in an ice bath for well over an hour? If you’re anything like us, even an icy plunge pool is scary enough, so spare a thought for Dutchman, Wim Hoff, now known as the ‘Ice Man’ after breaking the Guinness World Record for the longest time spent in direct contact with ice. In January 2009, he stayed submerged in an ice bath for 1 hour and 42 minutes – let’s hope his heart is still beating after that! What’s beautiful about the Guinness World Records is that they celebrate individuality in all four corners of the world.

I rue that day in 1918 when those big bags of flustering oestrogen were first allowed to cackle in the hallowed halls of Westminster. Since then it has all sadly gone down hill. Men can make decisions decisively, we revel in our staunch code of ethics and honour. None of that of course can be said about the meddling politically correct aberrations these women bring to the place. One cannot simply pat them on the bottom and tell them to trot along now, or order them to get you a coffee. It is our biological nature as men to delegate, to make war, to sign treaties and to stand on the parapet of ultimate power as masters of our own domain, and not to pander to these fastidious harridans. Women’s domain is that of nurturing the family, of cooking and ironing, having babies, looking after your little blighters, and warming the bed at night. Anything else is sacrilegious to the natural biological way as has been proven recently.” Mr Hensley who gave the speech in the House of Commons today was mobbed by 23 female MPs who pulled his trousers down and slapped him about in front of a small crowd. When Order Meant Order “To see this gentleman of the house so furiously put upon meddled with my gastric juices somewhat. This chap was literally turfed out of the place sans trousers, and what for? Yes, exactly, for saying what is on most male MPs’ mind,” an Honourable Gentleman, who wished to remain anonymous out of fear, revealed after the altercation.

Trial by Twitter is now a very real thing, where your reputation can be sullied with just a few characters, who needs a court of law or a workplace tribunal? Twitter, and select media venues are now used for complete assassinations, thirty year careers thrown into the bubbling sewers with a few mere clicks. “I didn’t want to sit on his lap, but I did.” Of course she did, she had to sit on his lap because he was the rising star of the news team, rising in more ways than one. Naturally, she was disgusted when her pert buttocks landing engineered a stiff one in the old chappy. She could have easily refused to sit on the guy’s lap but where would be the fun in that? Ok, the guy was an idiot for endangering his career but why did she not bring up the issue at the time? Because it would mess with her career, who wants a disruptive tribunal? Why not wait twenty years and destroy by media? This latest operation is most certainly being orchestrated by the extreme left Marxists of the good ol’ US of A, as it has that sort of Soviet feminist axe grind feel to it.

The upper echelons are above all law, but sometimes there has to be a few offerings to the circus lions from the top table. Either that, or the spotlight might fall on the top of the pyramid. One thing is for sure, somewhere along the line, these chumps offended the wrong person at the wrong time. Sacrificial lambs You see, by ruining all the reputations of multiple men online without trial, who is to say they can’t do it to the one they hate the most, the prez. We already know the Don likes to grab a woman by the pussy, so this revelation gives us an understanding that there are further gems waiting in storage by his enemies to be released. Trump, who himself is a heavy Twitter user will no doubt be drawn in to the new details which will be published soon. He can’t help himself, and will further draw his own execution via media. Can the Teflon Don survive such a well orchestrated media onslaught as the various women are trotted out with little stories to tell and their #metoo tags? That all depends on his followers and as good Christians whether they can forgive such behaviour?

As for her husband, Bill, Harvey Weinstein looks like a choir boy next to that guy. The recent revelation that the Clintons and DNC paid for ‘golden shower‘ dirt on Donald Trump from MI6 operatives in Russia, was for many, the final nail in the coffin. This habitual behaviour of acting ‘above the law’ and the multiple pieces of evidence pointing to corruption by the Clintons, means a level of toxicity that even the Democrats are souring over. So, it is to the sea with the Clinton family of crims, and this is where deep sea exploration, ExCorp have been sequestered to complete an underwater housing pod life sustainment system for the toxic family. Chief engineer, Neil Hargreaves, says that the toxic Clintons, much like nuclear waste, will be “isolated from the world” but will “live relatively good lives under the sea”. The multi-million dollar scheme to put the Clintons 15,000 feet below sea level will be funded by the DNC and money retrieved from the Clinton Foundation. “It’s gonna cost to put away the toxic Clintons underwater in a humane way, but thanks to the latest technology we have found solutions to the problem. The pods will have their own oxygen supply and source from a botanical pod, we can also filter in oxygen from the water. There will be a desalination machine so that will be a sustainable water system. The Clintons can survive under there for years to come. For Bill, we will provide weekly supplies of young ladies through a shuttle system, and for Hillary, more ladies, but the butch type. There will also be a security system, so if the Clintons try to escape at any time, the monitoring security team will be immediately alerted.

According to the new feminist equality law if a man looks at a woman in any circumstance they would violate the law and a rape charge would be forthcoming. “We have new officers who have been trained in the new feminist law, and the officers will all be female so there can be no discrepancies,” Smalstrapp added.

Reminiscent of a Diana sitting alone next to an almighty towering Taj Mahal, here too is May, alone and cutting a very lonely figure. With news of leaks in German newspapers orchestrated by EU attack dog Selmayr, a veritable German Alsatian who revels in spreading disinfo, lies, and leaked conversations, Theresa May is now a floundering dame in the dark, there is no Thatcherite strength here, just a woman in the darkness. As far as these false negotiations and time-wasting nonsense goes, many could have told the naive willing Theresa May a year ago that nothing would happen because all the EU wants to do is to eek out a massive payment from Britain as a leaving punishment. The reasoning behind the EU is that making a former member state pay up a large ransom will deter anyone else from leaving the Soviet EU. No Deal This is the only sane, and logical thing to do under the circumstances. By leaving with a No Deal, Britain will hold its head up high and keep its honour. Theresa May must take the No Deal route and fuck the EU up the ass. This is the only solution to the humiliation, the ridiculous ransom, blackmail.

Is this fair, that Tfl and the Labour Mayor of London should punish those poorer families who have older cars, diesel vehicles or small businesses? The hypocrisy and corruption that led up to this Toxin Tax will not make any difference to the traffic smog levels in London but is just a revenue seeking venture to bolster the coffers of Tfl even further than they already are. None of this makes any sense when you have countries like China and the USA putting out so much carbon emissions every year that London is a but a tiny speck in pollution levels. With buses churning up tonnes of emissions every year, they blight the roads, usually have no one in them, and travel in packs of four. Something needs to be done about London buses, the most polluting filthy wastes of space on the old crumbling tiny roads. London’s roads, built for the horse and carriage are now resplendent with multiple lanes, one for the bikes, one for buses and taxis, and a tiny designated lane for cars. Rip the whole lot up and start again, because with parked cars on each side of the road anyway, there is so little space to manoeuvre, you might as well buy a bulldozer to go through the whole fucking lot. Driving in London today is a nightmare so awful that it is best to simply stay at home. Trying to traverse the fucking rude Eastern European maniac drivers with foreign plates, the white van men, the crazed taxi drivers, Chelsea tractors, the exalted cyclists and the behemoth buses which clog everything up is a hellish torture that is so depraved in its horror it leaves one to think of nothing but anger. First of all someone needs to teach the millions of EU drivers the rules of road in Britain, however they simply come over here and do as they do in Bucharest. There are no British laws that apply to these road users, as they can accrue as many tickets or fines as they want, something that comes down to their non-British untraceable vehicle registrations. So, good luck with getting their T-Tax, because they’re exempt. As in every regime ruled by extreme socialists Labour, London is now the ban city of the world. The Labour Mayor is banning portrayals of women in bikinis on posters, banning older cars, banning Uber, and next on the line will probably ban free speech to speak against his ridiculous plans to fuck London up further than it already is.

English literature undergraduates were apparently cautioned beforehand that a lecture focusing on Titus Andronicus and The Comedy of Errors would include “discussions of sexual violence” and “sexual assault”. Because of the ‘snowflake’ generation, the trigger warnings were posted in the English Faculty’s ‘Notes on Lectures’ document which is circulated to students at the university, but somehow bypassed Mr. Clewes. More ‘trigger warning’ One of his friends at the campus was angry that Clewes had not been warned about the Shakespeare piece more prominently before his untimely death. “We live in a constant state of shock and terror. Like what if I suddenly read or see something that upsets me, but it happens every day now. He should have been warned. Why were there no trigger warnings on the manuscript? Yesterday, I was watching the TV when an episode of Martin Scorcese’s Casino came on. I was not warned and nearly died from the shock of watching the film. No warnings mean we could have heart attacks from the shock. This is serious people. Are you not as scared as us? How could you do this to us?” Many triggered students are now calling for the banning or censorship of major parts of all Shakespeare plays. Last week, a Cambridge undergraduate student studying Ancient History was hospitalised after he read about Gaius Caligula by Suetonius. He is still in a coma and may never wake up.

One must understand, that in today’s global economy, everything is interconnected. If we see ripples in Japan or China, we also see effects of these ripples on Wall Street and London. However, if the behemoth goes down in sixty seconds, then the whole globe catches a cold. We’re talking the U.S. and its economy. The music stops — silence As in all crashes, it is a waiting game to see the exact bottom, to see some point of recovery, but as the fear spreads, there will be those who will be buying, they will be cleaning up, they will be filling their boots with as much stock as they can take. This whilst martial law is in place, where anarchy and looting hits the streets as all welfare and medical assistance is halted, and sectarian clashes blight the landscape. There may never be a recovery, simply because there are elements within the deep government who first need to resolve certain issues. Their main concern is in cleaning the swamp, in cleansing America of the undesirables, in reducing the population which has become a huge burden on the country and its resources. These issues, may take many years or decades to work through before any sort of financial recovery is allowed. From there, it will be a time of renewal, and those who have survived will be instrumental in rebuilding their nation once again. The future is clouded in smoke, but some can still see deep into the tape of time and warn of the dangers of complicity, of unawareness, and of being unprepared.

From weakness comes strength, and this is what always happens in Europe. The current EU leaders have created the environment for fascist nazi groups to flourish by flooding EU countries with masses of immigrants in little time. As Adolf Hitler was elected Chancellor on 30 January 1933, his dictatorship and subsequent wars were enabled by the weakness of Hindeberg issuing the Reichstag Fire Decree which nullified civil liberties. So too, we have inroads in Austria, with the win of Sebastian Kurz, the youngest world leader at only 31, he is seeking to make a coalition government with the far-right Freedom party (FPÖ). History repeats itself in interesting ways, as the future sees nothing but ovens burning day and night, as the bones of Romanians, gypsies, gays, blacks, Asians, Jews, Muslims and other assorted so-called Untermensch roast. It will start slowly, as it always does. Then the fever will spread to other parts of the EU, as so many have been angered by the invasions over decades that have tainted their lands. People, supposedly normal, turn extreme when their schools fill up with foreigners, their towns are blighted and their hospital beds taken up by freeloading migrants. This time, the anger will be severe – it already is at seething level – but there is a palpable anger intrinsic in Europe today amongst the ordinary populace that is bubbling with rage, ready to spill over. The people will come together to oust the politicians who have perpetuated their nightmare existence amongst the ‘offensive looking’ foreigners who take all the resources that should be there for the indigenous peoples’ benefit. The currently blind hierarchy of the EU, are too concerned with their massive expense accounts and sauna sessions to see even the simplest of human emotions bubbling from underneath them. They are so high up in their ivory towers that they are completely ignorant to what is really happening. The future of the current hierarchy of the EU lies with their heads on spikes, or in front of a firing squad, or simply torn to pieces by the crowds of rage-filled people. Naturally, to see the likes of Jean Claude Juncker with his head on a stick would be an adorable sight to behold, however, Mr. Juncker is himself a Nazi, and his past is full of Nazi ancestry, so he will just change his tune in alignment of the rising fascists to keep his place. He will keep his cognac and his daily date with a different barely legal filly brought to his office. Just as the German populace turned a blind eye to what happened to the Jews, and the French populace welcomed the Nazis into their country with open arms, there will be many who join the new EU fascist entity, either in the military or simply as a citizen. All of these people, they will on the day turn a blind eye when the ovens are turned back on. You crazy fools who fled your countries from war to get into the EU, who fled from Sub-Saharan Africa where there is nothing to come to the EU, and all the other economic migrants, there will be nowhere to run. You will have fled your previous life, but run instead into a trap, and as they push you into the ovens, dead or alive, you will rue the day that you thought about fleeing your homeland. Europe will be cleansed once again, and the newly reborn EU Fourth Reich will once again attempt to rule for another claimed ‘thousand years’.

Their actions are against the national interest and they seek to damage the UK by siding with our enemies. This makes Remainers very dangerous to the UK’s security and national well-being. “We have studied the political ideology of Remainers and found them to either be communists, Marxist sympathisers or extreme socialists who are using treacherous methods to try to derail Brexit thus harming Britain even further. Remainers are siding with the EU and Britain’s enemies, who wish to punish the UK and destroy its economy. Never Trust a Remainer “We have also delved into the workings of the Treasury and Cabinet and found many past and present within these governmental establishments as Remainers. Their every movement and action is to derail Britain’s progress and their allegiance lies solely in the undemocratic European Commission. These Remainers are therefore dangerous enemy agents embedded within the British government who are working against the country. These people should be viewed as treasonous traitors to the United Kingdom, and Her Majesty’s sovereign nation. “The relevant security forces should thus take these threats against the UK very seriously. Remainers are not only entrenched within the governmental system working as spies and conducting clandestine operations against the UK, like Project Fear, as well as passing British secrets to the enemy, they undermine our security and should be rooted out and expelled. The Rise of Communism in Britain “The major political parties have all been infected by the Remainers, and it is up to party leaders and administrators to root out these traitors and expel them from the parties involved in British politics. “There is not much mention of this fact, but Britain is now on a war footing, and these spies within our system are committing treason. There is no other discourse but to compile a list of Remainers who are trying to damage Britain’s democratic processes, and to punish them either with imprisonment or expel them from the UK. Remainers are in the same league as terrorists, espionage, and treasonous traitors.” Remainers are Not to Be Trusted Remember if you see a dangerous Remainer or know of one, ignore everything that they say, and in the future hopefully they will be silenced forever for their treasonous anti-British treachery and their allegiance to the enemy.'], ['Met. Police: “Criminals Free to Commit Crime Without Prosecution”', 'Crime Free-For-All There have been collective cheers across the capital from criminals as a senior Metropolitan police officer declared an amnesty on most crimes committed. What this means is burglaries, assaults, criminal damage, drugs and theft will not be pursued by the police. This new policy leaves a massive green light to criminals, not only the ones in the UK but across the world to come here to create more crime. Albanian mafia member, Bekim ‘Big Issue’ Dragusha, who operates 15 brothels in the capital as well as runs a lucrative burglary and pickpocketing team, was happy about the new police scheme not to prosecute his hard working employees. “Thanks to EU we come here and make big business.

I just told my officers to stand down. In a few months let’s see what happens?” There are even calls by the Met to relax more serious crime responses, like murder or rape. “We are testing a new scheme in Lambeth council, where if you commit murder, you will be liable to investigation only after your third killing.

The strongest teams defensively were those whom possessed the strongest defenders – no-nonsense guys such as Leeds’ Norman Hunter, Chelsea’s Ron Harris and Liverpool’s Ron Yeats. Some of the ‘tackles’ unleashed on a regular basis by such players would warrant straight red card, lengthy bans and even possible criminal charges in the modern day EPL, therefore defenders have to be more savvy, more skilful and less prone to scything down opponents. This means that to be successful defensively, teams require that their midfield give their defence an important extra layer of protection. It’s therefore no surprise that Manchester United have improved in spades this season following the capture of Nemanja Matic from Chelsea. Any kind of Man Utd tactical analysis would point to the deployment of Matic in the defensive midfielder role as being key to Mourinho’s men’s successful start to the 2017-18 season. Chelsea’s sale of Matic from their 2016-17 EPL-winning side was an immense surprise, and, judging by Antonio Conte’s side’s lacklustre start to their title defence, it could prove to be a costly mistake. True that in Tiemoue Bakayoko’s signing Conte prepared a replacement for Matic, but this is Bakayoko’s first season in the EPL and the £40 million received for Matic just does not instantly replace three excellent seasons of EPL experience. Last term Chelsea conceded only thirty-three goals in thirty-eight games. So far this term they have conceded ten in ten – a slight increase. Last season Manchester United shipped twenty-nine goals in thirty-eight games which was not a bad return at all, but this season they have the tightest defence of all teams in the EPL, conceding a miniscule four goals. There are of course other reasons why Manchester United have improved defensively this season (Phil Jones is having his best season for the club by far), but the impact of Matic cannot be under-estimated. At the end of last season Mourinho was quoted as saying he was looking for a ‘Matic-type’ player, but the ex-Chelsea boss may not have dreamed that he would ever land Matic himself. Not many in the footballing world would have dreamed that Matic – still only twenty-nine – would have been allowed to exit the Emirates so easily, and especially not to one of Chelsea’s biggest EPL rivals. Although primarily a defensive midfield player, Matic can usually be found all over the pitch – wherever the opposition has the ball, in fact. If Matic is not breaking down the play, he’s helping to recover the ball for his team. Last season Chelsea left the tackling to N’Golo Kante which lessened Matic’s typical impact for the side and may have convinced Conte that a younger replacement in Bakayoko was a good idea. Mourinho has used Matic in the same role – this time alongside Ander Herrera – and Matic has proven he still has a lot more to give in his career. Chelsea’s loss is very, very much United’s gain.'], ['Feminist Model Sues Men Who Look at Her', 'As she posed on the front steps of the Sixty Beverly Hills Hotel, Coco’s bold fashion statement saw her almost completely expose herself to the cameras. The only catch — if you are male and look at her, you are immediately handed a signed form from a lawyer waiting around the corner suing you for looking at her body. “I can dress like this but it does not mean a man can look at me. I am wearing a dress with a strategically placed metal ring gripping the two sides of my dress together across my massive heaving bust to make sure they are barely kept under wraps. That does not mean that you have the right as a male to look at what I am flouting. It is my feminist right to wear what I want, but it is not your right as a male to be attracted to me or my body.” Coco’s lawyer had a busy time throughout the night as any male caught even glancing towards her was handed the form suing them for sexism and something that is called ‘eye-ball rape’, a new statute created in the California courts, where women are given rights way above any men. One guilty man who was sued was close to tears as he said that he looked at her bust momentarily because there was pretty much nowhere else to look at. “Her lawyer handed me the form saying that I will be sued for over $500,000 for the crime of looking at her bust.

What the hacker did not reveal is the iCloud phone source where all these trophy pictures came from — Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein fits the profile exactly, as he liked to catalogue his exploits. This is what sexual predator/rapists do according to criminologists. The photo of a youthful Jennifer Lawrence wryly smiling whilst exhibiting a glazed face is most definitely a Weinstein trademark trophy photo. After those photos were taken, Lawrence was propelled into great fame via the Hunger Games. She, much like other actresses had earned her way to the top by being a ‘good girl’. Any internet search comes up with a treasure trove of multiple photos of actresses in compromised positions, for all to see and download. Fapocalypse The Fappening photo dump is proof that many actresses in Hollywood have to put out, or get out. As much as the claims of walking out on Weinstein go, these are mere fabrications to keep a public profile and honour. There is no actress in this world who will ever admit she got down on her knees to get a role, for a start she has most probably relegated that awful memory to the ass end of her memory, an amnesiac trauma that is forgotten, secondly, to admit to such a thing would be career suicide. Instead, there is a wall of silence. Weinstein had power because he could get these girls roles in films that would make them famous. He exploited this for his own pleasure much to the agony and desperation of these young women who needed a break — that final hurdle into the limelight and the red carpet. Sadly for the exploited, the Fappening has come back to haunt these actresses like a bad case of the clap. It just keeps getting dredged up time and time again. Once the pictures hit the net, they are nigh on impossible to erase, a moment these actresses have to live over and over again, a recurring nightmare that ceases to go away. One can only feel a certain sense of dismay and bewilderment to see such intimate pictures of assorted starlets displayed for everyone to see. Is there a ‘feel sorry for them’ factor, after all these are human beings displaying their private parts, their glazed faces, and their ultimate greed, for it is their pure hunger for fame and money that made them do it? There should be no remorse, either for them, or for Weinstein. They laid their beds all too willingly.'], ['Is it Anti-Semitic to Chastise Monster Harvey Weinstein?', 'Weinstein portrayed as an anti-semitic stereotype of a Jew snatching away young gentile women “He is a Jew who used his position of power to get young poor Gentile women to submit to him sexually on promises of stardom. I wouldn’t say this is something that is new, but I feel there is a lot of anti-semitic feeling against Weinstein. For example, if it was a Christian director who did these horrible things, they would just brush it under the carpet, but because Weinstein fulfils the stereotypical role of a fat grotesquely ugly big-nosed Jew who takes your Gentile women away to abuse, he is now being pilloried and expelled from Hollywood,” one of Weinstein’s friends revealed on Wednesday. So why now? It begs the question, because Weinstein was tolerated for his behaviour for thirty years, but only now has he been truly publicly exposed. Even though she knew, Meryl Streep called Weinstein “god“, a few years ago, then only backtracked when the façade had broken across the whole media. Michael Obama praised Weinstein as a “wonderful human being, a good friend, and just a powerhouse” whilst probably knowing about his reputation as a sexual molester and corrupt individual. Since the horrific persecution of European Jews in WW2, there has been a terrific recovery across the world over 90 years later, and today Jewish people are hugely successful across pretty much every sector one can think of, but this should not lead to complacency and abuse of power. We asked social analyst, Giles McBain, about the sudden shift in attitude towards Harvey Weinstein especially regarding anti-semitism. “The reason Harvey Weinstein was protected for all those years, was precisely because he was Jewish. People were scared, not only for their jobs, but if they said anything they would be called anti-semitic. It is forbidden these days to say anything against prominent Jews, especially in the entertainment business. It comes down to the saying: “To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticise”. So what precipitated the fall for this monstrous sexual predator? Well, it’s not anti-semitism when your fellow Jews have enough of your antics. Especially when Weinstein was haemorrhaging company money on shutting women up payoffs and losing large sums on failed film projects. You see he was tolerated when he was making the hits, but when that dried up, he was thrown to the dogs, by his own kind. That’s not anti-semitism, it’s just Hollywood money politics.” Now, there’s just a free-for-all, as Weinstein is persona non grata pretty much everywhere, even amongst his own kind. They washed their hands of him. Some rumours now doing the circuit allude to Weinstein escaping to Europe a la Polanski, another Jewish Hollywoodite who was expelled for pretty much the same reason. In Europe, Weinstein could still follow his pursuit of young girls but would most probably have to pay large sums of money to keep that sort of lifestyle. The most probable outcome is that he will get away with everything with some very good lawyers, and be back in Hollywood within five years or less.'], ['Book Review: Mr Trump Goes to Washington', 'I f you want to read something that may give you a little chuckle here or there, how about a satirical review of Mr Trump’s election campaign, and his early days in office? As far as the much maligned presidency of Donald Trump goes, there is much to be said of his rhetoric versus his action. Here is a guy who said he would ban all Muslims from entering the U.S., yet spectacularly backtracked on his promise. Here is a guy that said he would repeal Obamacare, but could not even get close to doing so; here is a guy who said he would build a wall along the Mexican border, but has not mentioned it since. All in all, Mr Trump has been pretty ineffectual — almost akin to a dog that has a large bark but no bite. Naturally the liberals are out to get Mr Trump at all costs, and it seems many Republicans are too. This is where we come to the little graphic satirical book capturing the first days of Mr Trump’s presidency by Michael Mayor. Almost like some kind of deranged Mr Men parody or is it Trumpton, we have Mr Trump Goes to Washington, published by Veloce. Each page turned depicts the president in fine graphical 3D tones with an especially elongated red tie, to accentuate the Don and his insane mission. The jokes come quick and fast, and will soon have you reaching for the toilet paper to wipe your pooey bottom. Yes, this book is good toilet reading. As with most graphical tomes, this book will have you coming back for more chuckles time after time, just flick to any page to see the antics of Mr Trump unfurl. Sadly there were no mentions of Mr Trump’s penchant for golden showers performed by beautiful Russian Natasha spies on the FSB payroll who also film the glorious proceedings, possibly to be used at a later date, when Putin needs a little laugh himself.

Emancipating female actresses “We go from one hotel room to another. Plenty of massage oil, scripts, contracts and a lot of towels to mop up all the white goo. Weinstein will be portrayed as a champion to female actresses everywhere by emancipating them with his spilled seed,” Steinberger added. The feel-good movie will reveal how Weinstein embraced women’s rights and feminism by supporting young actresses everywhere. Contractual lubrication “In the morning’s he would have two or three, then by the afternoon he would help four or five more actresses extend their careers.

Imagine the shock on their faces as they are regaled by stories of Weinstein masturbating in front of pretty female reporters then unloading his junk into a pot plant after she rejected his advances — here is Harvey Weinstein, a champion of women, a gender-equality apostle, a change agent who knew the progressive socialist liberal agenda. The reason scumbags like Weinstein can get away with what they do for years is because they pretend to be liberal nice-folk, as well as wielding massive amounts of power in the film industry. Sure, Harvey Weinstein looks like a fat sweating maggot, but he can have any fawning starlet in the room if he wishes because he can get these starlets a place in the lights, you know the spotlights and red carpets. Blow this fat sweating malevolent movie mogul, and they get their careers a major boost, but they gotta swallow and do it right, no cum dodging. Here was a guy who attended Planned Parenthood galas. He co-hosted lavish fundraisers for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weinstein helped fund the Gloria Steinem Endowed Chair in Media, Culture and Feminist Studies at Rutgers. All the while, he was getting young ladies who wanted to be top actresses to go down on him, promising them the world whilst on the other hand paying off other women who wanted to sue him for sexual abuse. Weinstein should have just been honest with his intentions, I mean who doesn’t want to fuck young beautiful women? If he was honest about it instead of painting himself as some male-feminist champion of women’s socialist rights, he would not be in the trouble he is today. It is quite hilarious and funny to see these pompous social justice warrior snowflake ‘progressive’ chipmunks now eating their words, as lie after lie is exposed, and abuse after abuse is catalogued for the daily papers.

The original Shaw Brothers/Ladd co. Blade Runner was a ground breaking monolith of a film from the year 1982, when nothing of this sort had ever been seen before; it transcended all barriers, its technological leaps within the science fiction genre were a world apart from anything ever envisioned before. The Jordan Cronenweth cinematography was magnificent, the atmospheric Vangelis soundtrack so to the point, the Scott direction perfect, and the casting fitted into every scene, every cell of that created a Philip K. Dick world that was truly believable. The sequel, breaks no ground, it just shows a very basic outline of what could have been, and is such a wasted opportunity that Ridley Scott must have been seriously fucked in the head to have anything to so with this pap, where everything is explained to the audience without any pathos, mystery or suspense. Pity poor Hans Zimmer, who had nothing to play off, just the same old scenes rehashed one after another. The paid media critics who were bundled handsome amounts of money to praise Blade Runner 2049 before the opening to build up hype and say it is the greatest movie ever made, are nothing but soulless unimaginative whores who have sold off a donkey to the unsuspecting audience for a tidy profit. To see noob Ryan Gosling walking around abandoned cities for minutes on end, and director Denis Villeneuve’s pathetic pallid bland scenes is an insult to any Blade Runner fan. The whole thing is also a major insult to originator Philip K. Dick who would vomit at the soulless delivery of the replicant story line. You can tell Harrison Ford is only doing this for a great pay off, and he just rambles through the crap scenes for the pay cheque. Sure, there are some interesting technological touches but it has not moved far enough from 1982. Technologically speaking, the world of 2049 is still entrenched in the past, albeit with little mentions of transhumanism and robots. Everything should not have to be explained to the audience. Where is the pathos? Where are the unanswered questions? The linear movement is so predictable that the whole plot of the film can be discerned within the first few minutes. Whatever it cost to make this film, it looks low-budget. Most of the budget presumably went in to hiring Harrison Ford. Shit dialogue, shit visuals, dumb CGI attempt to reproduce Sean Young a la Rogue One, shit story line, predictable and boring. All in all a huge fucking disappointment.

Performance and Battery The performance cores are 25% faster, with high-efficiency cores a staggering 70% than anything Apple has used in the phones previously. And for those of us constantly scrolling and surfing on our phones, the iPhone X offers an improved battery performance with two hours extra scrolling time that the iPhone 7. Worth the Cash? There are a load more features to the iPhone 10 including a fantastic camera and Animojis to needlessly fill our day. There is no doubt that this handset is a gigantic leap, although the jury is out on how far forward it takes us. If you have the cash and love the tech, go for it.

All democratic voters are to be treated with extreme prejudice and a good kick up the backside.” No Democracy Allowed in EU Although the EU stormtroopers stopped many from voting, the 90% result for independence for Catalonia was summarily rejected by the EU and Spain, and the democratically held referendum labelled as illegal. Jean Claude Juncker was adamant that the use of violence to thwart the democratic process was justified: “We can’t have people exercising the right to democracy in the EU. If this ever happens, there will not be an EU left. This is why we ordered the stormtroopers to stop the democracy from happening. Not on my watch will there be democracy..tch.. We are already stopping the Britisher schweinhunds by delaying their Brexit as much as possible and that idiot Theresa May is so gullible and naive she believes what we say to her (laughs out). No, mes amis, no democracy in the EU. We have rules for a reason, and democracy is against all of these rules made by the unelected EU Commission.” As Jean Claude Juncker once said during a referendum where the French people were asked if there should be more EU and less democracy: “If it’s a Yes, we will say ‘on we go’, and if it’s a No we will say ‘we continue’.”'], ['Epica Awards Deadline Extended to Friday 13th Aaaargh!', 'Don’t be spooked by this, it’s just another day in the calendar although it’s Friday the 13th..and the Epica Awards is looming over the dark foreboding mountains and smiling with a certain creative je ne sais quoi smile..

This time, the trophy are many dead Trump voting American concert goers at a Las Vegas Country music festival. The continual chugging sound of machine gun fire resonates through the night sky as bullets tear through the bodies of more innocents caught up in the chaos. How this sort of horror justifies anything is beyond comprehension, but presumably to a wild eyed Jihadist, heavily indoctrinated and maybe on some sort of amphetamine, it is a free for all, and every bullet that hits is justified in their belief system? How Trump will react to this is not clear, but for someone who is a staunch anti-Islamist, he will no doubt find a way to increase the pain, although he has been wholly ineffectual since becoming president? The current governmental position is that there is no terrorism involved, although the evidence may change in the next few days. Of course, it could be the other way, and ISIS falsely puts their mark on a domestic nutcase who went on a shooting spree, either way, the truth may never be known. For ISIS, this latest shooting spree will no doubt be seen as a great victory, and it seems there is movement to increasing attacks on the West, as a direct response to Middle Eastern incursions resulting in the loss of their territory. Unfortunately, time is on the side of ISIS and all the other Jihadist organisations. They have all the time in the world to conduct these operations over and over again, for centuries if need be, that is unless the so-called Western meddling in the Middle East ceases. The Jihadists do not only have all the time in the world, but they have an unlimited amount of brainwashed assets ready and waiting in the wings for the next massacre of Westerners. As the West utilises drones and bombs at 30,000 feet to execute one guy here or there, at great cost, the clinical strikes are clean and remove the carnage from the controlling operators. The Jihadists on the other hand utilise the more terrifying approach of dealing violence and death on the ground, where it is in your face, and creeps into your very being with its viciousness. By opening up the Islamic can of worms, has the West bitten off more than it can chew? To progress towards a new singular World Order, Islam will have to be tamed or eradicated completely. It is true to say, for the globalists, that a NWO cannot coexist with an Islamic belief system, as it is the exact opposite to the tenets of a one world system. This is why they have been doing everything they can for the past few decades to slowly dismantle Islam from the inside.'], ['Anti-British Eurocrat Guy Verhofstadt Obsessed by Peas', '“I have to say, very honestly, as much as I hate and detest anything British, when it comes to your peas, there is nothing like that. They are so green, succulent, and they smell so fresh especially just after they pop out of the pod. I love the way they roll around the plate, maybe if I am having a cod nicely battered and some chips, you know frites, but in the Britain they cut the potato thicker, and I even tried mushy peas once, oh they were exquisite a true culinary delight,” Mr Verhofstadt said. When asked at a recent EU conference about the response to Brexit Mr. Verhofstadt added: “I sometimes get peas delivered from the British Isles to my château on the outskirts of Brussels. Frozen peas, yes, frozen, I like to pull down my underpants on a hot day then put a bag of frozen peas over my man peas in their pod. Yes, if the temperature is hot on a sunny day frozen peas always do the trick in cooling you down. Sensational feeling. “Pea soup!

I give them a little pea soup before I get my torture tools out. Oops, did I give it away. No, it is a joke, I am not a psychopath. I love peas, the more the better, even as a dessert you can have a few raw peas on your flambé, or an omelette mushrooms, peas and cheese. “I was telling Jean Claude, I said to him, in the morning when you wake up, instead of a cognac glass try a plate of peas, maybe soaked in cognac. He tried it the next day and told me that it really hit the spot. What’s more, when he met Merkel a few hours later, he told me he burped and a little pea flew out of his mouth and landed on her cleavage. Oh la la where could he look?

III, you know to do some filing, but all he does is kneel on the floor now. It’s hard because I asked him to move some files across the room to our copy administration person and it took him half an hour to go four metres, by that time we had lost an important client, now we just email the documents,” an exasperated boss at Google’s Mountain View campus revealed. Jacquinda Quanell Jackson, a secretary for a top law firm in New York City, is also under the microscope as she kneels now on a constant basis, even delivering coffee to her bosses whilst on one knee. “I aksed her, I said, Jacquinda, I been working six hours straight on this case, can you get me the Masterson papers and a cup of coffee. Took her another four hours to bring the things I wanted to the office on one knee.

It would have taken her at least an hour to shuffle whilst kneeling to the emergency equipment cupboard, so the doctor bypassed her, rushed to the cupboard, retrieved the defibrillator and rushed to save the man’s life. If was not for his quick thinking, the patient would have died,” a furious hospital administrator added.

Why not watch the game of rugby instead? In fact, the game of rugby is what American football is derived from, one of the only differences in the game is that rugby players do not wear steel helmets or body armour. It is claimed that a pupil of Rugby school, William Webb Ellis, invented the game of rugby in 1823, however this is disputed by some. American football adopted many of the features of the game of rugby including the goal posts, the shape of the ball, and the scoring system where the ball crosses the goal post line and is touched down. Dear Ex-NFL fans, It is truly disgraceful that highly-paid members of your teams as well as NFL management have sided with a ridiculous protest, when the field should be about the game and nothing else. To disrespect the American national anthem when so many have died so that people can live under a free democracy is the biggest kick in the teeth, especially for veterans and those serving in the military today. U.S. soldiers put their lives at risk every day, not for some over-paid ungrateful idiot who cannot string a coherent sentence together, to get down on their knee and disrespect you the fans, America and all who gave their lives for the country. This is why you should watch Rugby Union right now. They do not show disrespect when the anthem is played, and would welcome you to the sport with open arms. Don’t forget, rugby is where American football came from, so why not go back to the real roots of the game. We welcome you with open arms. Rugby is a game played by real men with no body pads, body armour, shoulder pads or steel helmets and no ridiculous socialist protests. Real injuries, real skill, real spirit — a real game.'], ['Experts: How It’s Going to Take At Least 10 More Years to Erase Obama Legacy', ' All the Social Justice Warriors, radical feminazis, trans social spreaders, anti-free speech, LGBTNXDSYs, Black Lives Matter, Antifa terrorists etc have all become even more enraged due to not only losing front of stage under the Obama supremacy but the new president Trump coming into ascendancy. Socialists, Marxists, Communists are actually more dangerous when they’re on the backfoot, because they have more to fight for, and become even more triggered than usual. “These people are brainwashed Marxist indoctrinated pawns of guys like Soros and Obama. “Their role is simply to divide communities, create a climate of hatred, and turn families against each other. “The funny thing is once they complete their jobs, they will be discarded like used tissues by their masters,” an informed person revealed about the plan. The brutal truth is that even though the U.S. is meant to be led by a Republican president, Donald Trump has been wholly ineffectual in pretty much every effort he has made to move America towards a more patriotic family orientated stance. This is because of the guerilla warfare tactics being used by the extreme leftists who are funded by various sovietized groups and rich individuals. “It will take many years of de-programming of America’s youth, who are now entrenched in their Safe Spaces and Microaggression politically correct socialist world and are mollycoddled every step of the way by their educators (Marxist indoctrinators). “Either, people pipe down, or within a year or so we will have civil war.

But an international team of researchers is rethinking how upgraded glasses could be useful—by turning the wearer’s nose bogies into a discreet power source. Computer scientists from SHAISTER University in South Korea, the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, the Georgia Institute of Technology in the United States, and Fukuoku University in Japan, took a unique approach to the smart glasses they designed. As detailed in a new paper, ItchyNoseBogey: Discreet Power Integration using proprietary energy cell technology in Smart Eyewear, being presented today at the International Symposium on Wearable Computers, instead of trying to carry around a massive battery pack they simply added a series of electrooculographic energy transducer lithium impulse generators to the bridge and nose pads of the glasses. These energy transducer cells are designed to measure electrical signals in and around the nose, and have been used for powering the Smart glasses from the bogeys of a user. Chief project engineer, Lee Yon Fuk, revealed that the “bigger the bogey, the longer you can charge the Smart Glasses” and that “sneezing your nose into a special electroconducting cellular energy transducing tissue” gives the device a much needed power surge. The smart glasses, which look no different than a regular pair of specs, are apparently able to discern between the wearer flicks, holding, or rubbing their bogeys with a finger, and those subtle movements can be translated into further electrical energy creation within the microbattery transducer charging system within the device. So imagine you’re sitting in a meeting and have to look like you’re paying rapt attention to your boss’ every word, but you’d rather be digging deep in your nasal cavity for that elusive, scratchy bogey. A simple finger in your nose, which wouldn’t look out of place, could let you jumpstart your device if it’s low on charge. The glasses love bogeys of all shapes and sizes, long greenies, sloppy sneezies or those hard edged bogies that you have to really dig for. The key aspect of these smart glasses is that you could be stuck in a desert where there are no usb power points, or you could be on a desert island where there is no electricity. Just dig into your nostrils, and pick out a nice juicy bogey, feed it into the integral power inducing system et voila, you now have enough power for a week. This incredible technology will be available next year, and already Barbara Streisand has ordered five pairs of Smart glasses from the tech team.

The Führer had been staying in the hotel when he heard the news of Germany’s defeat at the hands of the Russians during the ill-fated Operation Barbarossa invasion of Russia. Auctioneer Ronnie Papadapadapapoulos said he believed the underwear was sent to the hotel’s laundry department but were rejected and were only returned after Hitler and his entourage had checked out in a hurry. The seller was the grandson of the hotel’s owners at the time. Ronnie, who owns Bilko’s Historical Auctions in Takoma Park, Maryland, where the 19-inch long white linen shorts sold for $6,737 (£4,991) to a private buyer, said they were in ‘pristine shit stained’ condition. He added: “People were flocking to this Adolf Hitler underwear like bluebottles to a freshly laid steamy doggy turd. “This is a very rare item, I mean it’s gotta Hitler shit stain directly down the back. People can actually smell it even after all those years. “They were retained in the family who owned the hotel, which is very prestigious, for almost 80 years, and when we got them they were wrapped in tissue paper in a box. The smell is still slightly there but over time it has faded. Nevertheless, it shows that Hitler was just a human, he shit his pants when the Russians pushed the Jerries out of Russia. “It’s a fascinating thing. It’s as close as you can get to Adolf Hitler, literally.” Ronnie, 58, who ruled out selling the shorts to any member of the political far right before the auction, added: “I imagine the buyer would probably frame the shorts. It would be the most talked about relic in the house.” Hitler stayed in the hotel a week before Germany was pushed out of Russia with a terrible defeat for the German army and Ronnie believes Hitler was touring the country ahead of returning to his retreat in the Bavarian mountains to lick his wounds. The item’s description read: “A monogrammed pair of Adolf Hitler’s striped white linen under shorts with a 12.5 inch skid mark in the back. The shorts are surprisingly large – 19-inches long, with a waist of about 39 inches.”'], ['Naive Theresa May So Gullible She Falls For Nigerian Email Scam', 'Poor old Theresa May, she hasn’t been having a good time of it lately. Scammed by the EU to extend Brexit by an extra two years so that the EU can charge Britain through the teeth, then add on an extra leaving bill on after that — May has committed the UK to financial slavery to the EU for many years to come. According to Theresa May’s senior aides, the PM is so gullible that she actually replied to a Nigerian email scam asking her to deposit $4.5 billion in an account in Lagos. Theresa May was so taken by the email in her inbox, that she bypassed key Treasury clearance protocols and okayed the funds herself, much to the chagrin of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. “She’s so naive, and gullible that we have to keep an eye on her at all times,” another Number 10 staff member told the Telegraph. The letter that Theresa May received was the classic Nigerian scam, and after much wrangling we were able to get some excerpts: REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL I am Dr. Bakundo Elotunde, the second cousin once removed of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Mnongo Elotunde. He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 5 space station in 1978. He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-15Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989. He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved. His other Soviet crew members returned to earth on the Soyuz T-15Z, but his place was taken up by return cargo. There have been occasional Progrez supply flights to keep him going since that time. He is in good humour, but wants to come home. In the 27-years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost $ 15 billion American Dollars. This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association. If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth. I am told this will cost $ 4.5 billion American Dollars. In order to access the his trust fund we need your assistance. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account or subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20 percent of the transferred sum, while 10 percent shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between the parties in the course of the transaction. You will be mandated to remit the balance 70 percent to other accounts in due course. Thankfully, the gullible PM was thwarted from sending any funds to Nigeria on Friday, when senior Treasury staff were alerted to the PM’s actions and stepped in to stop the money transfer at the last moment. “Luckily we saved not only the PM’s blushes, but the taxpayer from falling foul from this terrible scam. We would like to alert anyone else who thinks about replying to any such email not to do so. Only the dumbest, most naive gullible idiot would fall for such a see-through scam, isn’t that right Mrs May?” the Foreign Secretary quipped during a press meeting on Monday.'], ['Uber Re-branded As Luber', 'The former taxi company Uber is re-branding its image and name after losing the almighty London contract thanks to Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan and TFL. “Our new image now is a big tube of lube, that’s why we’re now called Luber,” Chief marketing strategist in charge of the project, Slippy Slider told the Evening Standard. The multi-million pound rebranding operation took two minutes to conceive thanks to the help of advertising agency Kitch Flannel Joelkins who won the contract after a massive bidding war between rival agencies. “I was at my Madam’s house, who I visit every Tuesday. I had just been given the Uber rebranding contract and just as I was slipping into my latex suit I stepped on a large tube of Lube and hit my head on the Madam’s boot.

Comedy has to walk a thin line, take risks,” he said. “Comedy is the lecherous little elf whispering in the king’s ear, always telling the truth about human behaviour.” Offending anyone is now pretty much forbidden, jokes are not allowed that relate to anything that is about human society or culture, the newspapers are filled with socialist snowflake censors masquerading as ‘journalists’ when they would not look out of place in the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984 or some deranged feminazi re-education facility in Soviet Russia. The media establishments from the right to the left are now censorship driven indoctrinated propaganda machines that constantly drive the politically correct message to their brainwashed audience. If for one second there is any dissent or an opposing opinion in the comments section, it is immediately deleted. There is now very little distinction between any mainstream media organization with regards to the PC agenda. The level of indoctrination of course comes firstly from the education system, where the latest generation are now called ‘snowflakes’ alluding to their propensity to be constantly offended by everything. Melt You To live a life as a ‘snowflake generation’ member must be truly intolerable, it is a state of perpetual distress, constant SJW marching with ridiculous signs aloft, and the threat of ones ‘safe space‘ being invaded so horribly that suicide probably crosses their intolerant blinkered micro-aggression frazzled minds on a constant basis. These are people who are supposed to be progressives but cannot progress above any thought apart from following other ‘snowflakes’ like lemmings onto the next useless dehumanising cause. Just fucking kill yourselves already, at least this will free up some carbon emissions on the planet. Thanks to these sovietized brainwashed jerks, comedy and humour is now something you find from watching past comedians and shows. The sad part is that it will get worse, and worse, like some sort of sharia ISIS wet dream, the last of the comedian warriors will be strung up, whipped and dragged through the streets in front of jeering politically correct crowds dressed all in grey suits. Is there a flicker of light at the end of this dystopian humourless socialist nightmare we are all now forced to live in? Everything is now censored to death, to laugh is now a crime, freedom of expression is a pipe dream that can only be realised by shutting up shop and living a life of silence. Yes, one can achieve true freedom of speech. Here is how: Only write on a typewriter, paper, or a computer not connected to the internet. Never publish your words. Don’t worry about this one, because no one in the current PC malaise will publish you any way. Read your words yourself and chuckle to yourself. Never show another soul what you wrote.'], ['Why Being Anti-EU Does Not Mean You Are Anti-Europe', 'The EU Commission staffed completely by unelected officials, leads the European Union L et us clear a few things up here. Europe is a beautiful continent with wonderful people, each country within Europe have their own customs, their own cuisine, and in all respects Europe is a great place to travel or live in — however, the EU, is a separate body to Europe, and this distinction is an important one. EU is a Separate Body to Europe The EU is a totalitarian state moving towards a super-state which will have its own autonomous army led by the Bundeswehr (German army). An EU army will not only be a threat to NATO but Russia will be coaxed eventually into conflict with this massive army on their very doorstep. The EU high command will want to achieve what Napoleon, and Hitler could not achieve. The EU is a pseudo fascistic soviet construct that was catapulted into supremacy after the Berlin Wall fell and Stasi agents swarmed into the system. Not only is the EU run by unelected bureaucrats, but it is a monolithical Borg-like juggernaut that overruns nations first economically, then slowly strips each nation of its identity and wealth. Unless you have communistic soviet values, there is no reason in hell why you want to be a subjugate of the EU, to have laws dictated to you each day, to have unjust fines and red tape put on your business sectors, and to have no say in how you spend your own money. Why on earth would anyone want to agree to such a thing, unless you are stupid or lazy, or both? What about the Schengen zone, a utopian idea which is inherently a good one in a world where there is no crime, terrorism or war? Here is a zone where there are no checks on the border leading to a vast corridor where heavy arms, drugs, sex trafficking, human trafficking and terrorists can travel with ease. Every time there is another terrorist atrocity, think about how those guys were aided by the Schengen zone — an idea that the EU Commission, an unelected body refuse to curtail to even stop these attacks on Europeans. It does not matter how many troops you have on the streets flashing their guns, the terrorists simply move around freely from one spot to another. There is also a serious disparity within the EU nations. The poor South opposed to the rich North. As of now, there is a vast population movement from the poor EU nations who entrench and colonise the richer nations in the EU. This mass migratory economically related movement has fuelled a serious disparity in the EU, and without balance of some sort, there will eventually be a tipping point, either with an economic crash or with serious civil unrest. EU is Undemocratic The major sticking point with the EU, is that it is undemocratic. Even the current EU president, Jean Claude Juncker has no qualms about admitting this : On British calls for a referendum over Lisbon Treaty “Of course there will be transfers of sovereignty. But would I be intelligent to draw the attention of public opinion to this fact?,” On French referendum over EU constitution “If it’s a Yes, we will say ‘on we go’, and if it’s a No we will say ‘we continue’,” On the introduction of the euro “We decide on something, leave it lying around, and wait and see what happens. If no one kicks up a fuss, because most people don’t understand what has been decided, we continue step by step until there is no turning back.” In fact the EU is so undemocratic, it is nigh on impossible to get out of it. We see this with Brexit, and how the unelected leaders seek to make it as hard as possible to leave. This mafia-like construct is the anti-thesis of everything that should reside in a Western democracy, and to find it deep in Europe like some octopus grip over nations is a sad sight to behold. Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader once stood back, post-perestroika and glasnost, looked at the EU and said in wonderment: “The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.” It is also with great puzzlement and bewilderment that there would be people in the UK or in any democratic nation who would not oppose the undemocratic sovietized EU. However, one only has to see the outraged Remoaners, brainwashed youth and Marxist politicians on the extreme left who do not oppose being ruled over by the EU. Therefore, one can only conclude that communism is once again making large inroads amongst large swathes of Britain’s population. One only has to read history to see that communism is not only a mass killing doctrine of about 160 million people, but it is a severely limiting construct on human freedom, and anyone who supports the EU is supporting this evil communistic agenda. Will they ever wake up from their stupor? Who knows? Once these people have been brainwashed by EU soviet propaganda and conditioning over many years, they are either so weak minded or unintelligent that they know nothing else. Within Britain today, treachery against democracy and freedom is very much alive. These Remoaners want us to live in an EU prison forever, and they will gladly relinquish their own Britishness for it, sell off their own countrymen, without qualms. These Lord and Lady Haws Haws need to either wake up or be somehow shut down, as they are inherently a danger to the democratic functioning of our nation.'], ['Interview With Author and Creative Epica Awards Editorial Director Mark Tungate', 'Mark Tungate As one of the jurors for the humour section in this year’s prestigious Epica Awards for creative excellence in the advertising world, the Daily Squib has also been given access to interview Mark Tungate, the Editorial Director for the Epica Awards. Mark Tungate, apart from being a stand up guy, is a journalist with 30 years of experience, who has written for everybody from the Financial Times and The Guardian to Campaign and Advertising Age. He is the author of several books about advertising and branding including Adland: A Global History of Advertising, Branded Beauty: How Marketing Changed the Way We Look and Fashion Brands. Daily Squib Editor Aur Esenbel Interviews Epica Awards Editorial Director and Author Mark Tungate AE – I grew up in the era of memorable advertising slogans like Beanz Meanz Heinz, J.R. Hartley and R.Whites Lemonade. One of the best adverts in my opinion has to be the Orwellian 1984 Apple computers parody advert directed by Ridley Scott. These were such memorable advertising experiences that they are still vivid moments in the memory today. Do you think the longevity of advertising has changed today, so that much of it is disposable or cloaked in cgi technology/photoshop it loses lasting character? MT – It sounds like we’re of the same generation – I remember those ads too. In fact I specifically remember my granddad singing the R. White’s Lemonade jingle and falling about laughing. I don’t think advertising has become disposable – as a commentator on the industry and the host of the Epica jury, I see fantastic ads all the time – but I think we have less available space in our brains. It’s the new/old problem of information deluge. So many images flicker past our eyes every day that we struggle to hold on to them. Plus we’re not really watching broadcast TV any more: we’re watching Netflix. So traditional ads not only have problems hooking themselves into our memories, they have problems reaching us in the first place. AE – I am a great fan of George Lois and his creative thought process. He once said in an interview on The David Susskind Show that “Advertising is poison gas. It should bring tears to your eyes, unhinge your nervous system, and knock you out.” This is the sort of creative technique the Daily Squib lives by, however do you think things have been watered down too much in the advertising business today, especially in the sense of political correctness? MT – Well, it’s certainly not for me to disagree with the great George Lois. I interviewed him once in his Greenwich Village home and he was incredibly gracious for a big guy with a history of fierceness. He was also predictably handy with an anecdote. In short, I think he’s righter today than he’s ever been: for the reasons above, if an ad doesn’t knock your socks off it’s going to be wiped from your mind minutes later. If you take a stroll through the Epica Awards archive you’ll see many ads that deliberately set out to send eyebrows skywards. This one, for example: HEIMAT Berlin “You’re alive. Do you remember?” Or this one: The Devil You Know – “Figaro” Bret Easton Ellis But perhaps the cleverest ads are the ones that manage to hold our attention without resorting to nudity or violence. Arnold Worldwide – “My Dad” AE – Of course, we could not talk about the subject of advertising and PR/Marketing without mentioning my all-time hero Edward Bernays, the pioneer of the Torches of Freedom, emancipating the women’s movement to smoke in public. Rather ominously, as another example, in the 1930s, Bernays worked on the Dixie Cup campaign which was designed to convince consumers that only disposable cups were sanitary by linking the imagery of an overflowing cup with subliminal images of vaginas and venereal disease. Even though he worked a lot in secrecy and through third parties, do you think Bernays’ guerilla techniques, especially regarding subliminal messages could be viable today? MT – It all sounds very Black Mirror, doesn’t it? These approaches might still work if you could sneak them past the client. Frankly I’m more worried about the rise of Artificial Intelligence. There have been a couple of examples lately of ads created by AI, and they always have something “off” about them. Perhaps we’re being brainwashed by machines. I wish AI would go away. As one of the characters in the movie Wargames commented: “I’d piss on a spark plug if I thought it’d do any good.” Saatchi’s New Directors’ Showcase Features an A.I.-Created Film AE – How has the internet generation’s low attention span affected advertising? I believe most people now switch off after less than three seconds, or do you think it has always been that hard to seize the attention of the viewer? MT – I’ve never been too convinced by the attention span argument. People watch hours and hours of Game of Thrones. My six-year-old son, who must have one of the lowest attention spans in history, will happily sit through a 90 minute movie if it captures his imagination. We watched Pixar’s “Up” this week. All the way through. Twice. I think if your “content”, to use the buzzword du jour, is captivating enough you can glue people to their seats for as long as you want. AE – Do you subscribe to the subtle school of advertising a la Ogilvy or the in your face Lois style? MT – Well, I fancy myself a wordsmith and David Ogilvy was one of the greatest copywriters of all time – not to mention a dapper gent – so I admit to being attracted to his style. The form is decidedly retro today, but a long copy ad could be a way of cutting through the clutter in some circumstances. A well-written poster ad works brilliantly while you’re waiting for the Tube, for example. Above all Ogilvy told a good tale in a witty manner, and that’s still a valid approach. If you must sell us something, at least do it with entertainment value and a touch of class. I think Epica partly exists to encourage that kind of advertising. AE – Do you think there is any role for satire in modern advertising, can satire sell? MT – Abso bleeding lutely! Take a look at this. It’s a genuine ad for Halo Top, a US ice cream brand. In fact it’s the answer to almost all of your questions. AE – A brilliant example may I dare say. Very Terry Gilliamesque and indeed does sum up the questions I asked. Thank you kindly for this very creative and insightful interview. Don’t forget the Epica Awards are still open for entries Deadline: September 30'], ['Lib Dems Want to Force Brits to All Wear EU Berets', 'During a recent Liberal Democrat conference in Bournemouth, Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader announced the proposed changes to compulsory head wear. “As Lib Dem leader and Chief Remoaner for Britain, I say to all our members that this EU beret is a jolly good idea. Once we reverse Brexit and are back in the comforting arms of Brussels, we shall make it law that every British EU citizen wear an EU beret at all times, even when asleep or in the shower.” The Lib Dem leader was then asked by one member whether they could take off the EU beret whilst swimming? “Absolutely not! All swimming baths will have special rubber EU berets on hand to give to swimmers to replace their woolly ones.” EU Sharia Beret Law Another EU beret wearing Lib Dem then asked Mr. Cable whether dead people or people in hospital surgery would be prosecuted for not wearing an EU beret? “At all times means at all times. Even if you’re dead in a coffin, you and your relatives will be prosecuted if found not to be wearing an EU beret. We have to show our profound love for Brussels at all times. Astronauts will not be exempt, and neither will the Queen. In fact, Her Royal Highness will have to wear an EU beret over her crown and if she doesn’t, she too would be prosecuted under EU law.” Luckily, the changes will only take place after Brexit is reversed by the Lib Dems.'], ['Tricks of Wise Binary Options Trading', 'What Wise Traders Do W ise traders are savvy people, mistrustful of other people, who always want to act on their own initiative. They want to make their own trading decisions, and even when they follow trade signals provided by someone else, they still apply their own criteria and decide not to follow some of the trade signals. Wise binary options trading is no different, and wise binary option traders are mistrustful of big promises and effortless money, they know that big profits are possible only through some kind of personal effort. So instead of focusing on popular stocks, such as Apple, or trading in the way that is most popular to trade, wise traders think differently. They will trade less popular stocks, they will trade binary options on two different stocks, and they will look to achieve true limited risk trades. By definition all binary options offer limited risk, since the initial premium is all you can lose. But wise binary traders take into account price and time analysis, probability patterns, and the possibility to make synthetic binary option trades. A synthetic binary option trade is one which consists of 2 or more carefully selected binary options, so that big risk is really limited, and so that the payout of one option offsets the cost of buying the other. These trading methods were developed by classic stock option traders in previous decades, they are not new concepts. It’s just that binary traders who know what they are doing, implement these old concepts using binary options and sometimes they combine them with a directional trade, such as a CFD trade, on the same underlying market. Wise Traders are Specialists Wise binary options trading is not different, and is about being a specialist. Even if you know a market extremely well, as far as the direction it will take, you can still be wrong on the timing and this means that a binary option will expire worthless. On markets such as EURUSD for example, is best to devise partially directional trades, with hedging insurance. You can make it so that you will make no profit if the market rises by 100 pips over 3 days, you will get your money back if starts dropping, and you will make a small, high probability profit if it does rise by more than 100 pips over 3 days. This can be done with a combination of binary options alone, or with the use of one more CFD trade. The point is that you can be wrong on the timing and still not lose money, or stand to lose too little compared to what you can make. Most markets are hard to predict on both price and time at the same time, there are scalping strategies where this can work. But in most cases, and for most markets, predictability of both price and time seems to exist between the one week and two week period. And this can work just fine with hedged trades where the options expire in 2 or 3 days, you simply place a series of these trades one after the other. Thirty minute binary options can also be profitable, using similar synthetic, hedged trades, and by taking advantage of specific time zones in the forex market. EURUSD for example is likely to touch new price levels during the London or New York trading session, and very likely not to touch new levels, during the Asian trading session. Synthetic hedged trades make less or much less profit than simple outright trades, but the probability of a profit, over many trades is extremely high.

Mother is inherently about liberal socialism and how it eventually leads to destruction, either when all the money runs out, or too many people ruin the party. Liberalism is permissive and inclusive to a point, but this permissiveness without filters always leads to an overcrowded, chaotic mess where all semblance of order is diminished in the end. There are contradictions to the model of socialist progressives, especially in the United States, where they say they are for free speech yet censor anything that is not their liberal point of view, look at socialist companies like Google and Facebook. The modern liberal social justice warrior that we find these days, find themselves portraying a stance that they are inclusive and progressive, however when it comes to opposing points of view especially from a conservative angle, they have some cut-off point and only see things in their blinkered socialist viewpoint. By allowing some of all, liberal socialists also allow all sorts of nastiness into their home, and from there things spiral. Look at socialist Venezuela today in a state of anarchy and civil war. Look at America’s black problem, created mainly by liberals and their policies over many years, the problem is getting worse every day. American liberals have basically enabled the majority of the black population to continue a lifetime of poverty by pushing the welfare system onto them, and once in there it is very hard to get out of, especially when African Americans are taught from youth by the system to be dependent on welfare. In the Internationalist sense, being permissive and inclusive with regards to the human diaspora is always a good thing, however it must be tempered with solid, knowledgeable judgement and a smattering of exclusivity. The film is also an allegory on how allowing everything without barrier into your own house (planet) you eventually are the harbinger of your own destruction. We can see this today in an overcrowded, overpopulated, polluted Malthusian nightmare of a planet ruled by liberals, albeit, greedy ones. Our whole planet’s eco system has been plundered and robbed by the same people who are now preaching about climate change and preserving the environment. This ultimate hypocrisy committed by the ruling liberal elite is one of the main reasons why many cannot take them seriously. However one views the allegorical context of the film, whether in a religious Christian context, political or societal, the film is quite clear cut in its message. We as a species are the bringers of our own doom, and the time we are at now, is the time when we will either excel to higher bounds, or deteriorate to the level of extinction, from which the eternal mother will make a circular rotation either starting with us again, or most likely without us. Whatever happens, the universe will carry on existing as if nothing happened, even if there is a total extinction event.'], ['Daily Squib Publishing Acquires 67% Stake in Rolling Stone Magazine Sale', '“It’s more a sign of the times.

The longer Britain stays in minefield of EU laws, the longer it will take for our own Justice system to make our own laws and govern our own country.

If a Brexiteer had been in charge, we would have left the EU months ago, but unfortunately the country is stuck with a weather beaten Remoaner who says one thing here, and does another thing there. Amongst all the EU-friendly ‘transition’ deals, the £30 billion payoffs, and kowtowing to every EU demand, Theresa May is moving along at a snail’s pace. She is a liability to Brexit, as is her Remainer dominated Cabinet. Brexit will never happen with Theresa May and Philip Hammond at the helm, because at the end of the day, they will call it ‘Brexit’ however nothing will have changed and Britain will still be a subjugate of the EU.

Unfortunately this is the technique of terrorists who wish to create terror, especially on soft targets like the London underground system. Every day millions of people use the underground system to travel to work and utilise it for their other travel needs. As a travel network it is highly crowded, not only with local Londoners but with tourists. London already had the 7/7 terror attacks and since then thankfully there have not been any more attacks, however the spate of atrocities created by terrorists on parliament and London bridges recently has seen an up tick in terror incidents within the central London area. Crowded places are tempting targets for terrorists which create a lot of fear within the public, this is why terrorists want to use these areas for their work. Should Londoners be vigilant? Of course, they should, but London has been attacked many times by many factions and people have lived their lives without kowtowing to terror. Thanks to the Labour, London Mayor’s lax view on security and a relatively un-policed London Underground there will most probably more terror attacks on the horizon. The Parson’s Green bomb did not fully detonate today, which will luckily give the security forces a good idea of who created the bomb. The fear is that terrorists could utilise bombs to spread chemical agents or viruses which would be spread throughout the underground system through the ventilation systems. Let us hope this terror attack did not use this bomb as a vehicle to distribute such an agent. What should you do to ensure you and your family’s safety? Limit your time in crowded places. If you can walk to a destination walk there. Do not use the underground unless it is wholly necessary.

J ean-Claude Juncker has claimed the UK will ultimately “regret” Brexit in comments which are likely to provoke a political firestorm. After an hour of addressing the European Parliament, Mr Juncker finally mentioned Brexit. The president of the European Commission said: “March 29, 2019, that will be the date when the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. This will be a very sad and tragic moment in our history as the EU will lose its primary cash cow.” Jean-Claude Juncker today addressed an “appeal to reason” to Great Britain to avert “destruction of a great world empire — the EU,” but he made it clear that rejection would mean an attack with all of the forces at the command of the EU powers. “In this hour and before this body,” the unelected president of the European Commission told the EU Reichstag in the presence of Belgian Kommandant Guy Verhofstadt, “I feel myself obliged to make one more appeal to reason to England.” “I do this not as a victor, but for the triumph of common sense.” Without delivering any ultimatum, Juncker said that it had never been on his desire or his aim to destroy the British “scum”. The president of the EU Commission warned against interpreting his appeal as weakness and said that “Farage may parry my words with the claim that I feel doubt or fear, but in any case I will have my knowledge that I acted rightly, according to my conscience.” The president said that his cardinal aims in foreign policy had been friendship with Britain. “Despite my sincere efforts it has not been possible,” he said, “to achieve the friendship with England which I believed would have been blessed by both.” Juncker made it clear that rejection of his appeal to “reason” would result in a “final” attack upon Britain with every resource that the EU led by Germany could throw into the battle. As he spoke German and EU trade sanctions were launched over the British Isles again slashing British shipping in what the EU had said was a mere preliminary to the long threatened “blitzkrieg” offensive by the European Union in another attempt to invade England for the second time since 1941. Juncker said that the EU armed forces, toughened by their mighty sweep through Europe, were stronger today than before the war started. The EU has a greater supply of munitions; iron, gasoline, food and other essentials are more than adequate, he declared, regardless of the length of the Brexit negotiations. Juncker said documents found in Jersey June 19 contained reports of secret meetings of the Brexit Council and that marginal notes by David Davies and Theresa May showed the “machinations of the Brexitmongerers regarding all EU nations.” They intended, he said, “to use Ireland for their own interest, turn Norway, Denmark, Poland and Sweden into a theatre of Brexit and had planned a bombardment of International trade deals bypassing the EU.” These “Brexiteers,” Juncker said, “inflicted an appalling fate on hundreds of thousands, even millions, of their own people, callously enforcing mass Brexit evacuations for their own people.” “What is coming will visit the people, not Farage, who will probably be in America with his dumbkoff mate, Trump,” Juncker said in caustic reference to the British MEP as a warning to the British people of the effects of EU blitzkrieg attack. “He may think the outcome will be the annihilation of the EU and Germany, but it will the destruction of a great world empire — the destruction of which was never my wish or aim.” Juncker recalled his speech of Oct. 6, in which he said he had stretched out his hand to England, even though he was then convinced of EU military and economic superiority and of the outcome of the Brexit. He said his hand had been rejected, as had all of his peace offers in the past. “I regret the victims the Brexit will exact among civilians in Britain as well as among EU citizens,” he said, “even though I know millions of young EU citizens are straining to fight England.” He warned Britain against viewing his appeal to reason as a weakness. “Farage may parry my words with the claim that I feel doubt or fear, but in any case I will have the knowledge that I acted rightly according to my conscience,” he said. Juncker praised Kommandant Verhofstadt and Verfügungstruppe, Colonel Martin Selmayr warmly for their participation in the war on Germany’s side. Juncker declared: “German-Franco EU relations have been thoroughly and decisively established, as even British statesmen will also learn.” Juncker said that he had heard the cry of Farage and the London politicians that the Brexit must go on. “I am not sure that they understand what such a Brexit will be,” he said. Juncker also paid grateful tribute to the EU parliament and EU leadership as well as to the civil population, “whom our enemies thought they could separate from me.” Juncker said that the men in various European countries who wanted “honest peace” had been denounced as “weaklings” or traitors or as “fifth columnists.” He denounced “the scribblers” who called such men fifth columnists and charge them with following a “criminal” policy. The victories of the EU in the west proved that he, Juncker, was right and his enemies wrong, the EU president continued. “We have established a front from the North Cape to the Spanish frontier and with incredibly small losses compared to the World Wars. All of this territory without a single shot being fired,” he said. Juncker reviewed the progress of the European Union from the beginning and repeated the German reasons for occupation of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, France, Spain, Portugal and Italy and the Low countries, declaring the EU tactics from the first had been to to subdue those nations both economically and politically and then to invade those countries. “Deputies, in the midst of a great battle for the freedom and greatness of the Great German Empire. I called you,” he said. “The necessity for this is an historic hour. “I asked from those who we have controlled and Lorded over for forty years to surrender their idea of Brexit. If Farage and the Brexiteers felt half the responsibility toward Europe that I did they never would have started the Brexit. “After the Brexit we will be able to recount how numerous severe blows and setbacks were overcome and converted into victory,” he added. “The only remarkable thing about the British is how such miserably equipped and poorly trained, abominable Brexiteers could be employed for such a serious task.”"], ['Jim Carrey Reveals the Truth at Meaningless Hollywood Awards Ceremony', 'Jim Carrey It’s hard to control some people, and that’s the truth of being Jim Carrey, a man who does know the truth about how meaningless and banal Hollywood celebrities are, unfortunately he is stuck as being one himself. “Here is a man stuck in the false plastic world of Hollywood.

There are many other companies pursuing the same goal in creating flying taxis/cars, but Lilium has surpassed its competitors with its superior approach, not only to design but its technological innovative approach to aeronautical engineering. This incredible machine could only be innovated by the masters of vehicular engineering, the Germans. Not only is the aeronautical design of the flying vehicle smooth simple, streamlined and classy, but its transition electrical propulsion VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) system is thoroughly unique and truly does embody what we want to see in the future skies. The Lilium Jet consists of a rigid winged body with 12 flaps. Each one carries three electric jet engines. Depending on the flight mode, the flaps tilt from a vertical into a horizontal position. At take-off, all flaps are tilted vertical, so that the engines can lift the aircraft. Once airborne, the flaps gradually tilt into a horizontal position, leading the aircraft to accelerate. When they have reached complete horizontal position, all lift necessary to stay aloft is provided by the wings as on a conventional aeroplane. The beauty of this system is its simplicity. In comparison to existing concepts, Lilium Jets require no gearboxes, no foldable or variable pitch propellers, no water-cooling, and no aerodynamic steering flaps. Just tiltable electric engines. What’s more: The Lilium Jet has the highest possible structural efficiency. As we can provide differential thrust from the engines in cruise flight, no stabilizing tail is necessary. This supreme feat of engineering excellence means that the Lilium Jet is highly efficient in its usage of energy, safe, and environmentally friendly.

A chronic disease or work-related illness usually lasts more than three months and cannot be prevent by vaccines or cured with the help of medication – and they don’t just disappear. As a business owner, you can identify risks through risk assessments and seeking advice based on the outcome. You should also ensure that all organisational factors as well as work-place pressures including targets and bonuses prevent staff from taking actions that carry a high risk. Improves employee retention & attracts new talent Another reason why it’s important for business owners to prioritise the well-being of their staff is to improve employee retention. Not only will the total amount of lost working days decrease since less people are likely to take sick leave, it will also reduce staff turnover. An employee retention strategy is a cost effective way of managing employee turnover. A high employee turnover can be costly which is why it’s vital to implement retention practices to support an organisation. Nowadays, employers are taking mental health in the work place more seriously than ever. Caring for your employee’s wellbeing also attracts the best talent because they can see that you take the health of your staff seriously. Encourages a collaborative workforce When you make the effort to look after your staff, they take care of the rest. When business owners take care of their employee’s they start to feel appreciated and stride to succeed. When it comes to collaboration in the work place, it involves giving each employee an equal opportunity to participate and share their ideas to achieve a common goal. Improves staff morale and focus Your employees make up a team of people you rely on every day, so you should make sure you take time to thank them for their hard work. A recent study has shown that more than 80% of engaged staff received some kind of recognition for their good work, whereas only 35% of unengaged staff did. Praising your staff for their good work doesn’t have to be complicated.

After much wrangling with Gina Miller’s press and security secretary, her management people finally okayed an exclusive interview with the most hated woman in Britain. Due to the immense number of death threats made to Ms Miller, we were ushered to a secure location somewhere in central London via a blacked out van and were told to put hoods over our heads when exiting the van to the secret location. After entering the front door, we were allowed to remove the hoods and this is what followed. The featureless hallway we are in opens up to a secure thick metal door, and the private security officer in front of me bangs the door three times then whispers a password through a small opening. After much clinking and clanking, the door is finally opened. My assistant and I are searched for the fourth time. Then we are led into another room where there are an assortment of old wooden chairs, a sparse light and security camera screens on all sides. Eventually, after fifteen minutes waiting, Gina Miller opens another door and shakes our hands, the interview is about to start. Interview with Gina Miller Miller: Thank you for coming. DS: Thank you for having us interview you. Miller: Please begin, but if you ask something too sensitive for security reasons I cannot answer. DS: Ms. Miller, why are you doing this? Many see you as an unelected tool of the EU or other forces trying to thwart the will of the people in a democratic referendum that took place on June 23 2016? Miller: I believe I am saving Britain by stopping it going out of the EU. DS: How are you saving Britain from leaving a totalitarian regime run by unelected eurocrats who dictate laws upon Britain and charge obscene amounts to the UK taxpayer for ruling over us? Miller: The people who help fund my cause do not think like that, they have business interests that would be damaged if Britain became a sovereign nation away from EU slavery. DS: Ah, the people who fund you. Namely George Soros, the Hungarian financier and the unelected EU Commission? Miller: Yes, and I have also put up some of my own wealth to stop Brexit from happening. I also have other big names behind my actions, including Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson, George Osborne, the SNP, Nick Clegg and Kenneth Clarke. DS: Certainly you have a lot of powerful people behind your court proceedings, however don’t you think it has come at a price, especially regarding your safety? Miller: I may be the most hated woman in Britain today but tomorrow when I stop Brexit, I shall be so hated that I think I will have to move out of Britain and go back to Guyana. DS: Yes, indeed it is quite interesting to see the level of hatred towards your person. You are certainly very sure of yourself, and that begs the question, you’re originally from Guyana, so why meddle with the English? Should you not let them be the masters of their own destiny after all it is their country and heritage? Miller: I actually don’t care for the English at all. I am only interested in the rights of EU people who came over to the UK so they could take the jobs of lazy English people and drive their wages down with cheap labour. You see, the EU is a Marxist construct and its modus operandi is to create equality for all citizens, and be led by an unelected hierarchy with vast expense accounts and salaries. Our agenda is the collectivisation of all wealth distributed to everyone on an equal basis, poor EU citizens taking the wealth of rich EU citizens. The rest of the population will eventually be consigned to a communistic equality in poverty after the wealth is distributed from those not within the EU high circle. DS: I can certainly see that poverty levels in some EU countries like Greece, Romania and Bulgaria are at unprecedented levels, but how will this benefit Britain, as a part of the EU? Miller: Because the peasants and low-skilled come to the UK, they use the NHS resources, they fill up the schools and use the benefits system to the full. It’s just another way of destroying Britain from the inside, economically and culturally. I already told you I hate the English. I want their culture to be destroyed from the inside, and so do my friends, who are funding my campaigns. DS: I see what you are doing, and so do many others, you are Britain’s enemy. You and the other Lord and Lady Haw Haws are out to kill off Britain once and for all. Under the EU, it would be designated as a mere zone, to be exploited. This is why many Britons voted to get out, they do not wish to be just a nameless zone in the EU or its cash cow and dictated to by faceless unelected EU technocrats. Miller: I refute that. Under the EU Britain will adhere to the laws and directives from Brussels which is ultimately ruled by Germany. I believe the Germans are better at organisation than the British. In fact, the EU countries today are part of the Greater German Empire. They were conquered without a single shot being fired, something Hitler could only dream about. DS: So, you’re saying the EU is essentially the Fourth Reich? Miller: Yes, and I am an agent who is backed by some very powerful people to stop Britain from escaping this EU communo-fascist bloc led by Germany. I am also backed by British traitors within the country who want the EU to rule over Britain. There are many who support communism and Marxist ideals within Britain today, and there is nothing anyone can do about these traitors who willingly want to sell off the country for a pittance. DS: There are also some Conservative MPs who support the EU. Are they traitors to Britain by supporting the communist EU bloc? Miller: Treachery comes in different shades. I would say these Conservative MPs who support the EU and my cause are more economically minded individuals. We pay them vast amounts of money for their support, and for that their allegiance to Britain magically fades away. DS: And they would be the sort of people who would easily sell their own kids off to medical research facilities in China. Thank you for clearing that one up. Miller: The EU Army will also strengthen the European Union. They are building a formidable force which will incorporate many military forces into one unit that will be separate of NATO. The EU is preparing for war with Russia, and this is why it is imperative that Britain stays in the EU. DS: But we don’t want a war with Russia. We also don’t want an EU Army. This is also why many voted out of the EU. It seems like 1939 all over again. We are seeing history repeat itself. Miller: Well, if Britain leaves the EU, it will not survive a Russian assault or one by the EU Army. DS: We have NATO and our American allies. We shall see about that. Miller: Good luck with your little British Empire. It’s over for you. Finished. I’m finished with this stupid interview too. You will never learn. One way or another I will stop Brexit, and no one can stop me. Goodbye! And if you print this interview I will personally get one of my paid thugs to break all your fingers and legs. (Miller storms out of the room and slams the door behind her) We are roughly escorted out of the premises and taken to our offices. The interview with the most hated woman in Britain, Gina Miller is definitely over.'], ['The Best Beaches Europe Has to Offer', 'W hen it comes to summer holidays, most of us will flock to the beach. Whether that’s a beach at home or abroad, we’re all looking for the best options for our breaks. Luckily, we’ve decided to look into what the best beaches Europe have to offer are, so all you have to worry about is packing and applying for your EHIC card at ukehic.com before you set off on your beach break. Canal D’Amour, Sidari, Greece Only 36km from the main town of Corfu, Sidari is known as one of the best tourist resorts in the area – not least because of its stunning beaches. The village is surrounded by stunning landscapes and lush greenery and forests, giving a very distinct contrast. The ‘Channel of Love’ (Canal D’Amour) is an idyllic location, surrounded by beautiful coves and canals formed by its unique rock formations. The waters are just as visually pleasing with their crystalline state, as well as being warm during the summer months for swimming – just avoid this beach when it’s windy! Santa Giulia Beach, Corsica With soft white sand and an aquamarine sea, Santa Giulia can rival any Caribbean beach. The shallow, calm waters make for perfect swimming with young kids or a paddle to cool off, and there are small areas of reef dotted about that you can wander out to. Visitors can enjoy the views of mountains and pines that only add to the stunning scenery that this beach has to offer. There is limited shade that gets taken up quickly, so consider bringing a sun shade, or be prepared to hire one out! Pregonda Beach, Menorca, Spain On the Island of Menorca, Pregonda Beach is the perfect location to discover. While it is perfect during the summer, it is equally so in the off-peak months when the beach is less crowded, giving you the opportunity to experience the beauty of the place in a whole new way. Pregonda proves to be one of the most beautiful beaches on the island, and with fine sand and warming sunshine all year around, you can be sure of the perfect visit no matter whether you’re travelling with friends, family, or alone! Monterosso al Mare, Cinque Terre, Italy Monterosso in Cinque Terre, Italy is another stunning European Beach. Crystalline waters and plenty of restaurants and hotels in the area make for the perfect holiday location, and the sandy beach only makes it all the more pleasant. Day beds and umbrellas are always available for hire during the summer. Be prepared for a bit of a wait, though. The crowded stands are understandably so simply because Monterosso is the only sand-covered area in the immediate area. Playa de las Teresitas, Santa Cruz, Tenerife Originally, this beach was nothing but rocks and black sand but in 1973, 270,000 tonnes of white sand was shipped from the Western Sahara all the way to the Playa de Las Teresitas to create an artificial beach. The two piers located tere and the long breakwater about 150 meters out from the beach were constructed to stop the sea from carrying out the white sand. It is now one of the most popular beaches in the Canary Islands, and is one of the very few beaches in Tenerife that do not have black, volcanic sand that most of the Canary Islands suffer from.'], ['Why Do Hurricanes Have Such Nice, Pleasant Names?', 'Homes in the Florida Keys destroyed by Hurricane Irma 2017 “Sure, we have hurricane Irma, Jose, Harvey. These are all pleasant unassuming names that do not indicate the great threat they have on human life. Why not have a hurricane called Ugly B*stard, or Nasty Sue, or F*cking B*tch Sarah? At least if we named these hurricanes with how we actually felt about them, maybe we could save more lives,” Carlos Fuentez, Chief of the Florida Hurricane Research Center, told CNN. The FHRC team took their new name suggestion to the streets of Miami to ask what people thought about nasty hurricane names. “I think you should call this Irma hurricane Puta Irma. I had to close all my shops and lose a lot of business because of this f*cking wh*re hurricane,” Jose Gonzalez, a local businessman told the team. One angry lady who was boarded up in her home said emphatically: “Just call Irma a c*nt. That’s the easiest and most succinct way of describing that bitch!” Well, it’s not very kid friendly but there are other suggestions too, call hurricanes after politicians that are universally despised by one faction or another. “You could call the hurricane Donald, or Hillary or how about Barack?” another angry gentleman said whilst pointing up into the clouds with an accusing finger. The politician naming hurricanes idea was however quashed after it was realised that it would simply add to the egos of the named politicians. “They would get even more power crazy. Obama already committed more crime and damage to the country, imagine if they named a hurricane after him. He would be walking around with his chest puffed out and swaggering around like he was a god or something. Forget that idea,” Mr Fuentez said.'], ['The Future of AI is Total Neurobehavioural Integration', 'There are many mapping the individual neurons of the human brain, and there are many creating super realistic models of the human face, however Dr. Mark Sagar is a true innovator because he is integrating every modelling factor into one AI interface. Working from New Zealand’s, Auckland Bioengineering Institute, Associate Professor Mark Sagar has gone as far as to create a baby artificial intelligent computer model that actually learns, and is rewarded by increases of dopamine in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop from which the basal ganglia portion of the loop drives the reward system. By modelling the various interconnected pathways of the neurological system, as well as the interrelation of the facial muscles, and the input system via the eyes, or camera on a computer, Dr. Sagar has effectively created an entity that responds to stimuli, good or bad, and can actually learn from its behaviour. Something that many labs around the world are probably trying to achieve as well, but has not been completed to the level and sophistication of Dr. Sagar and his team. Ray Kurzweil talked about the Singularity, the moment in time when AI supersedes human intelligence as a sentient being, when artificial superintelligence will abruptly trigger runaway technological growth, resulting in unfathomable changes to human civilization. At the rate we are going now, this seminal moment will occur at a time earlier than thought, and we will have superintelligent entities who will eventually become sentient beings, they will be self-aware and be able to create their own machines, or modifications to technology already created. In essence, the biological part of all life will be understood completely, as mapping every part of the human brain, every neuron and electrical impulse, will bring completely new understanding to what it means to be human, or a machine. The functional abilities and capabilities to this technology are immeasurable, as their introduction will change every facet of the lives of humans, and could even be utilised to create exact copies of ones mind. If we can now backup the data on our computers today, tomorrow we will be backing up our brains. This event, would effectively reverse death, as our biological bodies deteriorate with time, the backups will live on. Going further into the future, your mind could easily by transplanted into a new body and brain, thus making biological death just a mere hiccup. Transhumanism is already detailing much of this concept, but it will certainly be a prerequisite that humans absorb the machines and vice versa, because without this coupling, only hardship will follow. Especially when the advanced machine looks down at the inferior intellect of the biological, an arms race that could end badly for humans. Of course, there will be military applications to all of this technology, and unfortunately there lies great danger in the adoption of sentient machines in the future that have the ability to kill. Already we are seeing autonomous drones flying over our heads constructed by the military, but here lies the distinct possibility that the future AI will not see humans as worthy of life. We would not be deemed as useful, we’re dumb compared to them, and naturally the weaker of any species always meets a sticky end, as the Neanderthals once did too. The work of Dr. Sagar is truly amazing, and it is rare to see such a complete understanding, all in one package, with true integration into creating a new entity. We must also however look at the moral points regarding the future though, for without that element philosophically speaking, humankind could eventually bear the brunt of their own creation.'], ['Students Cry in Pain As ‘Safe Spaces’ Invaded On Campus', "Some students take shelter in a corridor after their 'safe space' was invaded on Wednesday “We had to console our students for hours after the terrible incident, which left four students hospitalised in an institution, and one student fighting for her life,” college professor, Eric Cohen, told the LA Times. Situated close to San Francisco, Berkeley College is known for its support of American socialist values like Marxism, Communism and is staunchly anti-liberty, anti-free speech. “We at Berkeley college pride ourselves in being upholders of the teachings of Karl Marx, Trotskyism, and the all American communist radicals like Saul Alinsky. Any other point of view is not important to us, because it does not exist to our belief system of indoctrination,” one student revealed prior to the safe space invasive incident. Safe Space Invasion The designated safe space which was invaded, was situated just outside the courtyard for Dwinelle Hall, and has since been cordoned off by the police. According to students who witnessed the invasion, a terrible wind blew autumn leaves from surrounding trees into the safe space even landing on the designated safe zone and some students. “I saw these autumnal leaves, literally fall on students’ heads as they sat in the safe space. Some leaves even landed on their books and luncheon bags. It was carnage, the invasion caused students to literally run for their lives as the leaves kept coming and coming. One guy tripped up as he ran and hit his head on a rock, another sprained his ankle, and another is now in intensive care as a leaf landed on his sandwich as he chomped down. He choked on it and went blue in the face,” Jonah Chang, a traumatised third year student recalled. Campus authorities have acted quickly in restoring the safe space by having all trees chopped down throughout the whole Berkeley university campus area. Students who were affected by the incident have been told not to watch the video below at all costs, or this could cause immeasurable mental anguish to their already damaged constitutions."], ['The Great British Fake Off', 'When it comes to fake, you just can’t get faker than this banal stale television sadism beating people over the head with fake plastic smiles and even faker bland drooping one-liners that could make your newly ovenised bread loaf sprout legs and dive head first into a winter pond full of ravenous ducks as a last suicidal jump to silence the pain. For fucks sake, is there not enough crud on the telly that the TV controllers have to regurgitate such quaffing buttered piss swilling crud as the Great British Fake Off. “Ready, set, fake!” It’s a fake bake, but one thing that would spice things up a little would be some white phosphorous dropped on the whole set to see the real baking that would occur. No doubt the presenters are paid vast amounts of shilling for this shit, but what else does the poor TV watcher have left these days apart from gay dancing shows, cooking shows and silly reality shows. The civilians are dying a slow death, baked, faked and all to the strains of the Macarena on constant loop. What does this say about modern Britain? Nothing, absolutely nothing, because there is nothing left, absolutely nothing has transcended even a millimetre towards some kind of mental absolution, some kind of understanding. The people who watch this grotesque pithy background stuff, are themselves lost in the mire, forgotten, and ultimately condemned to a perpetual dystopian nightmare of televisual torture. Hell definitely is a real thing, that is if you watch anything on the telly these days.'], ['Celebration of Migration: World’s 25 Most Successful 1st and 2nd Generation Migrants Revealed', 'Natalie Portman A new study by easyESTA has revealed 25 of the most pioneering first and second generation migrants. This interactive celebration of migration explores the heritage and careers of migrants from arts and literature, entertainment, politics, sports and science and technology. Celebrating diversity, the piece discusses influential men and women from different nationalities, and breaks down their (often surprising) family migration history. Commissioned by easyESTA, ‘25 of the most successful and influential migrants of all time…’ highlights the impact of migration on the world’s cultures and industries. Whether performing sensational escape acts or starring in critically acclaimed films, migration has heavily impacted upon the lives of actresses, musicians, illusionists and game developers. Controlled Migration is Good For Nations You may know Natalie Portman for her role in Black Swan but did you know that she was born in Jerusalem? Alongside Portman is the Kenyan-Mexican Lupita Nyong’o and Zanzibari Freddie Mercury, the Queen frontman. Henry Kissinger, the most famous living statesman today was born in Germany and eventually emigrated to the United States fleeing the Nazi regime in 1938. Diversity Through Controlled Migration easyESTA’s unique look of how history and heritage intertwine among remarkable migrants is ultimately a celebration of migration when the topic is seldom out of the headlines. A spokesperson from easyESTA said: “Culture is incredibly important to us at easyESTA, we commissioned this study to better understand the significance of migration and how migration has positively impacted on different industries. “The research surprised us with how diverse people really are. We gained insight into the migrants’ physical and metaphorical journeys. By understanding the cultures that have influenced the migrants’ lives, a new meaning has been added to their legacies.” View the incredible chart here'], ['How Kim and His Little EMP Toy Could Take USA to 19th Century', 'Americans reduced to the horse and cart “Electromagnetic pulses destroy electronics because they induce a very strong current in the electronic circuitry, causing different parts of the electronics to couple, short-circuiting them or even inducing such a large current that the circuits themselves melt or fuse together, rendering the electronics unusable. “Turning off electronics will not protect them because the EMP is the source of energy that induces current in the circuits. The only way to protect them would be to place them in a Faraday Cage,” an informed member of the public revealed on Monday. So, unless you put all your electronic devices, computers, phones etc into a Faraday cage prior to an EMP attack, you’re screwed. It is certain that there will not be any warning prior to a surprise EMP attack. The same goes for any vehicle past the date of 1986, the solenoids and electronics will get fried in an EMP attack. The best option is to own a 4-wheel drive Jeep pre-1986 because you will be going through rugged terrain away from the starving armed hordes on foot. One of the best road vehicles you can own after an EMP blast is a Harley Davidson MT350E motorcycle, with military spec wiring that will shield it from EMP. Harley Davidson MT350 Motor bike As for the effects of an EMP blast, on any nation, let alone the USA, the effects are devastating. No electricity grid, no water, and no communications. There will be no Facebook, Twitter or Google, as all their data centres would be fried. All cell networks would also be fried, and any call to an emergency service will go unanswered. All paper money will become worthless in a single day, and the only thing of value will be food, water, weapons, shelter, transport and gold. “Within 24 hours of an EMP blast by North Korea directly over the centre of the country, most of America (excluding some parts of the Eastern, Western coasts) would be catapulted back into the early 19th century (pre-1820). All Americans would effectively become the Amish albeit with heavy weaponry. If you don’t have candles, you’re shit out of luck. If you don’t have an immediate year’s supply of food and water, you’ll be shit out of luck too. All supermarkets would have been emptied within the first few hours of an EMP attack, once that’s all gone, there will never be any re-deliveries, that’s it. As for the military, they will stay where they are, as they have no cause to endanger themselves. The military will have prepared and their electronics will be intact, but civilians will be out of luck. The only thing left to do for the remaining government will be to wait until the majority of the population either kill themselves off or die of starvation within 18 months,” an ex-military commander outlined. Living in a metro area in the United States today may be convenient, but after an EMP attack, the cities will be killing zones. That’s why you have to get the fuck out of dodge as soon as there is an attack. Hopefully you will own a suitable vehicle that is not susceptible to EMP blasts. Always have a bag ready (bug out bag) for such emergencies, stockpiled with all the necessary survival materials. All supermarkets will have empty shelves within 24 hours of an EMP strike Once out of the city, you will head for your designated safe house, which you will have prepared earlier. If that does not exist, you will be best served heading towards Canada, past the border “slash” extending from Maine to Alaska, and the forests there where you will have to build a suitable shelter for you and your family. Do not head towards Mexico, or you will die. There are even further dangers present after an EMP attack, and that is a full invasion from a foreign force. We could be talking about anything from the Russians to the North Koreans committing a full ground invasion on a country that has been crippled by an EMP attack. As a survivor, you will have to make provisions for this, and retreat to an area where there is little or no human population or military bases. The USA, as a nation, which uses up 60% of the earth’s resources, would be reduced to using zero in a single day. This may be the only positive factor about an attack on America utilising EMP. However, the vacuum created by the loss of the US, and its vast economy will be devastating to the rest of the world’s economy. Once again, the lands which had been taken from the Native Americans will be returned to them, and the tribes will roam the same open prairies their ancestors roamed.'], ['FBI Labels Antifa as Domestic Terrorists', 'Antifa is now officially a violent domestic terrorist group according to the FBI and Homeland Security Confidential records reveal that the heavily George Soros funded group Antifa have been labelled as “domestic terrorists’ by the FBI and Homeland Security. After a spate of extreme violence over the past few months in the United States, the spotlight is not only on the right wing fascists, but the extreme left wing fascists as well. The recent Charlottesville debacle showed the extreme levels of violence the Antifa group were prepared to go to to put forward their message, however, it seems the message they were trying to put forward has been lost in translation. “Antifa is meant to mean Anti-fascist, however, the group is acting like a violent fascist group, and in effect, they should be fighting themselves. They are also meant to stand for anti-racism, but this element is never addressed in their violent ridden rallies. I would go far as to say the group does not care one iota for minority groups, and is committing acts of extreme violence as a statement of anarchy more than anything else,” Miles Kudro, an independent observer of the various groups revealed, Thursday.'], ['Living Your Single Life to the Full – Londoners Prefer to be Alone', 'T he Martin Scorcese film Taxi Driver hit the nail on the head with the eternal loner, wandering the big city, all these people around — yet, so alone. In every big city worldwide including London, reside the Travis Bickle’s, alone, alienated, yet being single does not have to be quite as raw as that portrayal, in fact, it can be quite calming and peaceful. London, the United Kingdom’s most ethnically diverse city, has a well-deserved reputation for being the loneliest city in these isles. There’s plenty of night life but the standoffishness of its inhabitants is legendary. The Jam dealt with the theme of alienation in their hit single, Strange Town. Taking on the perspective of an alien landing in the British capital, Paul Weller offered a stark view of the isolation felt by outsiders. Those words written in 1979 apply equally today. But being single isn’t necessarily about moving to a new town or city. It can simply be timing; friends in long-term relationships while you’re in ‘transition’ or wilfully single. There’s a lot of that about; Betway Insider recently commissioned a study, What are the Odds?, which took lifetime events and occurrences. There was a 1 in 8 chance of staying with your first love; for most people it means they will know a long-term couple who go from school through adult life together. Yet as EurekAlert! found last year, being single isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Bella DePaulo, PHD, observed that “the preoccupation with the perils of loneliness can obscure the profound benefits of solitude.” We’re not talking the Greta Garbo “I want to be alone” – OK so it’s a misquote(!) but it’s been adopted by society – but finding the tranquillity to make sense of life through the moments of ‘me time’. There’s a difference between being alone and being lonely. The two are the mutual preserve of the singleton. Indeed, the report claims that “when people marry, they become more insular.” In contrast, single people were more open and felt more in charge of their lives. That’s down to the compromises necessary in a relationship. A key reason for the ‘never-marrieds’ being happier is goal-fulfilment. Contrary to the widely-held and media-fed perception, single people are likely to enjoy a richer social life than their married counterparts. The sole focus of their enjoyment is themselves and no need to compromise over what activities or groups to take part in. Swipe To Your Partner That’s not to say it’s all wine and roses. In the 21st Century, the electronic world is often the basis for meeting new people. Dating apps are the way forward and the root cause for the rise in Repetitive Stress Injury cases; who knew swiping left caused such problems. It’s hardly surprising that numbers of app users is increasing, even discounting those searching for an illicit relationship. The number of marriages taking place up to 2014 is dropping. In 1934, there were 342,000 marriages; in 2014, it fell to 247,000. That doesn’t seem much but consider that the population of the United Kingdom was 46.66m and had risen to 64.352m in 2014. The underlying percentage in that eighty-year spell fell from 0.73% of the population being married to 0.38%; that’s a staggering drop but hardly unsurprising with the changing demographics of the population. And while the age-old joke about men being commitment-phobes may be one of the reasons for the change but it seems the modern-day Londoner is taking the concept to a whole new level. It’s a city to have fun in, even for the worst dullard in existence. London lends itself to the single life. Unless your salary is comfortably in six figures, it’s unlikely that you own your own place or even rent a home by yourself. Flat-sharing with a married couple is an uncomfortable experience unless you’re a couple moving into the situation. With an estimated 60% of wages going on the average Londoner’s wage, the bills play havoc with your wallet or purse. There’s a massive plus side to this. It means you can lead a Peter Pan existence, living like a student well into so-called maturity. This time though, you’ve got a disposable income although with the rising costs of the capital city, it’s by no means certain that you’ll be out living the high life every night of the week. But DePaulo is using her research as a call to arms. The University of California scientist is determined to promote equality of status for the unwed. “It is time for a more accurate portrayal of single people and single life,” DePaulo declared. “One that recognizes the real strengths and resilience of people who are single, and what makes their lives so meaningful.” Say it loud, I’m single and I’m proud.'], ['Like Playing Games on Your Computer?

Dota 2 is developed by Valve, the company behind Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2, and it is classified as a MOBA.

After much soul searching and deliberation on the implications this could have on Star Wars fans we can slowly unearth some of the leaked details and find out what they mean. We can reveal that Luke Skywalker is the last Jedi. Also, Luke Skywalker is not only a jedi and has links with the Force, but he owns a lightsaber too. This incredible finding will have most fans gasping for air in sheer dismay, can you imagine, Luke also owns a lightsaber? In the film, cinema watchers will be able to see Luke Skywalker holding the previously mentioned lightsaber and waving it around. He will also teach others to do the same thing. Imagine that? Luke Skywalker is not only a jedi but he can hold a lightsaber and wave it around whilst talking about the Force. Incredible. This new film will blow you away at the intricate details revealed once and for all. But here’s the clincher. Luke Skywalker is not only a jedi, he lives on a rocky island where there is no food, no vegetation and is surrounded by freezing sea on a planet that looks suspiciously like Scotland or maybe Ireland. So not only is Luke Skywalker a jedi who can hold a lightsaber well, he lives on a rocky island in a distant sea with no food or water or anything. He does not even get any Amazon deliveries, and there is no supermarket around the corner to get some fags and booze, or even a chippy, or heaven forbid, some wifi. Absolutely shit around. Nothing, just a jedi with a lightsaber and an occasional person who comes along who wants to be a jedi too. This time though, we can reveal that it’s a wee lass who turns up on the rocky shore. The sad thing is, Luke does not shag her, imagine after all those years, a nice bit of totty lands on your shores, it would be a mad scramble to even get a sniff of her scent. But no, Luke Skywalker is a jedi who can hold a lightsaber and talks about the Force and lives on a rocky island with nothing there. That’s all he fucking does for fucks sake. According to the leaked text, the film after this next one, will also feature Luke Skywalker back on the rock island, doing pretty much nothing again, but still holding a lightsaber and talking about the Force because he’s a jedi and maybe something a lil extra might happen, who knows? Can’t wait. May the Force be with you.'], ['Daily Squib Appointed As One of Jurors For Prestigious Epica Advertising Awards', 'P art of what has made the Epica Awards stand out for 30 years is its jury.

We’re changing all the names of Southern state towns, so Gettysburg will be renamed as Kanyetown, and Charlottesville will be renamed as Obamaville, and the Dukes of Hazzard will be renamed as the Pimps of Jigga,” one of the directors of the board of Stasi Censors told the New York Times. By effectively banning everything about the era of black slavery, the socialists not only erase history, but cause great harm on America because people will now forget about the symbols of slavery. They will no longer think of the injustice and wrong committed on African slaves all those years ago, effectively leaving history to repeat itself again, and again. Without reminders of the past good or bad, humans are destined to repeat their history. Deleting all the marks of slavery only strengthens the hatred of the nigger, the eternal nigger is thus born. The socialists are inadvertently creating another backlash, they are opening wounds which were closed many years ago, and they are endangering black America once again. One can never deny the conquerors of America, the European white stock built their nation, through immense cruelty and hardship, wiping out millions of Native Americans, and utilising the ‘inferior’ negro to build their infrastructure. Nevertheless, the white man possessed the cunning, the brain power to Lord over the others, without him, there would be no highways, bridges, trains, computers or governmental structure to hold everything together. There would be no scientific or technical accomplishments, no space travel or medical cures. The hard truth is that without the ingenuity and sheer will of the European settlers, America would not be the immense power it is today, and it is to this end, that they will never give up their status, or old money, to anyone, least the black population. Therefore, socialists and their permanent state of soviet equality revolution and their feeble attempts to erase history only strengthens the opposing forces of those who hold the actual keys to the conquering of a continent many years ago and the right to rule today as well as tomorrow. Gone With the Wind The African American problem will never be solved because the chasm is too wide, culturally, the rift is so wide that it will never be bridged, intellectually, scientifically or how ever much money George Soros throws at the various soviet justice warriors he aclaims. The reason equality will never be achieved is not only because of difference in human ability, but because of the spectre of superiority. Blacks do not want equality, they want superiority, as do the whites, the yellows, the greens, the purples and all the others. This is the sad part about the human condition. “I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and black races. There is physical difference between the two which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position.” Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America. The conquerors always win…but frankly my dear, I don’t give a damn..'], ['Has Plastique Narcissist Macron Gone Over the Top With Makeup Bill?', 'Emmanuel Macron, the current French President has been chastised for his penchant for beautification and the extraordinary bills to the French taxpayer this is causing. Mr Macron’s office confirmed a report on his beauty spending published by French news magazine Le Point, but said it was nothing to do with the ‘peasant class’ therefore they should just ‘shut up and eat cake’. “The President is awoken in the palace by numerous servants in the morning who bring him his daily newspaper, lightly ironed, of course, then a continental breakfast avec some extra bits we cannot divulge to le public. After the calves milk bath siphoned from the best herds in Normandy, servants will attend to Monsieur President’s toileting needs, this requires a staff of four persons, one to lift, one to hold, one to shake and the other to wipe. The makeup session requires four hours and the dressing of the president an additional hour. After this, the hairdresser, who is flown in from the South of France every day, enters the living quarters for a preliminary discussion on how the daily styling should go, after much discussion, and sometimes argument, a decision is made and the hairdresser begins the day’s work for approximately three hours. Et voila, after all of that, Le President is ready to go to work,” Macron’s personal palace courtier, Jean Pierre Quatorze, revealed to the French papers. The report said costs included the pay for a freelance makeup artist for television appearances and trips abroad as well as an ecouterie of staff for menial jobs numbering in the thousands. But it is not the first time the hair and makeup bill for a French head of state has raised eyebrows. In 2016, it was reported that Macron’s predecessor Francois Hollande had a hairdresser on contract for €10,000 a month despite him hardly having any hair. Mr Macron, 39, became France’s youngest ever president in May after beating far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in the country’s election. With youth on his side, the reason behind his expensive makeup habit remains unclear.'], ['Archaeologists: Why Romans Had Big Butts', ' “We found some huge asses, I mean we’re talking Kardashian territory. The men had unusually big bottoms but the women had huge butts that sometimes dragged along the ground when they walked in their togas,” chief archaeologist and professor of anthropology at Oxford university, Dean Taylor, reveals in a new series to be aired on Channel 4 in the autumn. Extensive research accumulated so much ass data that the team did not know where to begin. From the far stretches of the Roman Empire, from Brittania to Mesopotamia, the rears of Roman subjects somehow evolved over the centuries to include extremely large buttocks. “Our theory is that it was an amalgamation of Roman culture and the food they ate. As each principality was taken over by the Romans, the locals adopted the Roman way of life, mostly sedentary accompanied with vast banquets and Bacchanalian practices.” The team also found that the bigger the butt, the higher in Roman status the holder would acquire. Decimus Multimus, a Senator from Apulia during Emperor Trajan’s reign was promoted to Consul purely based on his ass size. Depictions of Roman asses can be found from fragments of pottery and other tile art, but it wasn’t until 2016 when a fully preserved Roman butt of a female was found near Mount Vesuvius. “We found our Roman butt Venus. Her ass is so well preserved in the volcanic ash that you can even see the pimples. The Italian Archaeological Society have advised us to keep her location secret so as not to create a butt pilgrimage for many thousands of tourists. However, our data shows that there was a massive increase in butt size during the reign of Gaius Caligula Caesar 37-41 AD. Much of this increase is probably due to the amount of Roman orgies and banquets during his brief reign,” the professor added. So, what happened after the Roman Empire descended into anarchy and most of the territory was lost? According to the team of archaeologists, people had to start working, tending fields and cattle, opening pizzerias and adopting the modern way of life. “From big butts we see a gradual decrease in size until we come to the modern day Italians, who just have regular sized asses today. Let us say it has been a wonderful journey for the Roman people throughout the centuries.” The Channel 4 series ‘Roman Butts and Togas’ will air in October.'], ['Confederate Statues to be Replaced By 100ft Trayvon Martin Statues', 'After all the Southern states of America have been purged of their historical statues, the Soros founded foundations and infiltrated city officials have agreed that each spot where a Confederate statue used to be, should be filled with a Trayvon Martin statue. Giancarlo Fuccini, renowned Italian sculptor was commissioned by the group who have taken over the City council to sculpt the piece of the angelic Trayvon, as a symbol of ‘peace’. “I had a few reference photos of Trayvon, as he was such an angelic peaceful character, but instead chose to sculpt his likeness in the form of Jesus, coming back to us and preaching peace and goodwill to all men,” Fuccini revealed on Monday. The 100ft statue will preside over the pulled down General Robert Lee statue, after it was defaced and pulled down so unceremoniously last week by communist thugs on another one of their rampages. Costing just under $52 million, the statue came under budget, and residents of Charlottesville were all too happy to foot the bill. “My state taxes just rose by 40% and this year we won’t be able to afford to heat our home, but I don’t care, as long as we are all politically correct and abide by the communist factions dictating to us on what we should or should not keep from past history, I’m happy,” resident Albert Collins, 52, told the local newspaper. The Southern Poverty Law Center, SPLC, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt foundation head quartered in Montgomery, Alabama, is pushing for major changes to all historical statues that do not agree with its hard left agenda. Funded by George Soros, the SPLC has even recruited tech groups like Apple, Google and Facebook to police its heavy censorship, politically correct soviet agenda of complete erasure of history online as well as offline.'], ['Hunchback of Notre Dame Takes Up Residency With Big Ben', "The bongs of Big Ben have not sounded for the final time for a four-year period of restoration work on the Elizabeth Tower. Au contraire, the bell still tolls… The tower is undergoing a £29m programme of renovation until 2021, but the prime minister and several MPs have raised concerns over the residency of a mysterious hunchback in the tower who is causing chaos by ringing the bells intermittently and at odd times. House of Commons authorities said a resident bell ringer had taken up residence in the tower late on Sunday night. The mysterious figure hails from Luxembourg via Brussels and the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, France. The Commons commission said it will review the efficacy of having the hunchback ringing the bell after complaints were raised, including by Theresa May, who said it “cannot be right” for the bells to be rung by such a “monstrous cognac swilling hunchback who does not even know the time of day”. A handful of MPs gathered by the members’ entrance to the Houses of Parliament on Monday to point up at the spires of the famous clock where they spied the hunchback sticking his hairy naked bottom at them and farting in their general direction. One formerly staunch Remainer MP was converted to euroscepticism on the spot: “I was outraged to see the vile hunchback sticking his derrier in our direction and telling us ‘English pigs’ to go ‘eff ourselves’, immediately I said to myself ‘..a hard Brexit and nothing else will suffice'”. In New Palace Yard, 200 parliamentary staff watched the bell bong, as the Hunchback of Notre Dame, Jean Claude Junckimodo, swung from the ropes leering manically and wearing a fool’s crown on his deformed head whilst waving an awful blue flag with some ghastly yellow stars on it. If anyone has any ideas or information on how to remove this meddling bastard, please contact the Houses of Parliament immediately?

It could be a van, truck, car or motorcycle. How could this happen, the pavement is meant to be a safe place for pedestrians? Not any more. Not one single city in Europe today is safe from the terror of knowing that at any moment a van could suddenly appear over the horizon and mow you down like a pin in a bowling alley. Suddenly your head swivels around, then crack, the van makes contact, your internal organs eviscerated, maybe your legs smashed beyond repair, or your brains thrown unceremoniously onto the warm pavement, the sun glistening with curiosity at their resting place. The immediate authorities and emergency services cannot do anything, they only appear after the event has happened. The EU refuses to close the Schengen zone, so nothing will be done there either. What is your course of action? How do you survive in a place where there is no safety, even on the sacrosanct pavement? Here are some tips on surviving in Europe where you as a civilian are not safe any more. If you wish to walk on any pavement, do not wear headphones, as this will impede your hearing and by the time you hear the truck careening towards you it will be too late. Never walk in the middle of a pavement. Always walk away from the road on the opposite edge. Always look behind you when walking every few seconds. This could save your life. Never look at your mobile phone when walking. Distractions like this could mean whether you live or die. Never push a pram on a pavement. This is common sense, because why would you want to put your children in danger? If a pavement terrorist attack is occurring a few feet away from you, do not just stand there, get away, run like fuck, get out of the way. Never walk on pavements. Instead drive on the road or stay at home.'], ['Barcelona Schengen Terrorist Massacre: No Comment', 'Just another terrorist attack within the Schengen zone From Libya into Italy is only a short ride by rubber dinghy, or from Morocco, or from the Baltic states, and the Black sea route. Every day thousands of people cross into the Schengen zone of Europe which is a borderless free travel corridor. Therefore, migrants crossing into Italy can be in Paris in two or three days, or they are free to travel anywhere they wish with little or no checks. This includes terrorists, drug runners, heavy arms dealers, people traffickers and any other nasty swine that wishes to commit acts of mass atrocity. Logically speaking in a time of war, which the majority of the Middle East/Ukraine is in, there would be a stop to such a porous border and zone as the Schengen, however we are living in times where civilian casualties by terrorism are simply looked on as collatoral damage by the EU Commission, a collection of unelected eurocratic monsters who despise democracy and the people they rule over. The people within the Schengen zone of the EU are therefore not cared for by the authorities, and every terrorist attack is brushed over, as the next one is awaited in eager anticipation. The sad fact is that we as humans see the mangled bodies on the pavements of whichever city in Europe has been attacked and gasp at the horror of it, the higher ups do not do that, they do not have a conscience or human emotions, and simply carry on with their insane dream of an EU Schengen utopia, whilst the actual horror is one of a dystopia in reality. So for now, there will be a brief mention of the recent attack in Barcelona where 13 innocent people were mowed down by a van, and countless injured, however the next attack is probably earmarked for another European city, so as usual nothing will be done about the Schengen zone by the incompetent corrupt unelected leaders of the EU, there is little point in commenting on each specific attack. People died, some were squashed, crushed, cracked open, but the EU Commission does not care. No more comment.'], ['Game of Thrones Peter Dinklage Eaten By Husky On Set', 'The little fellow was opining eloquently about his role as Hand to the Queen of Dragons when one of the huge huskies on the set decided it was meal time. “We feed them a good load of meat every day, but sometimes it ain’t enough,” Game of Thrones dog keeper, Tony Fernando revealed after the sordid incident. One minute he was there.. According to Amelia Clarke who plays Daenerys Targaryen, it only took a few gulps, and she had lost her dear Tyrion. This could be a major setback for the Game of Thrones crew, because it is very hard to find such a well-spoken midget. “First we get hacked, then this happened, it’s as if there has been some kind of weird curse put on us. Now we need to find another height-challenged actor as good as Dinklage was,” one of the multitude of directors told CNN entertainment. The Game of Thrones set was last night besieged by mages, Maesters, and a fully naked Carice van Houten rolling around the fire ridden grounds trying to bring Dinklage back. Let’s hope the next episode’s filming will not be wrought with such setbacks.'], ['Bonnie Tyler to be Resurrected From the Dead For Total Eclipse', 'Raised from the vaults of guilty pleasure listening enthusiasts around the world, the zombified toe curling voice of Bonnie Tyler is to address the celestial skies. “She’s not only been dug up from a long stasis since 1983, but many of the walking dead who inhabit the ship’s decks will also awaken momentarily when she sings to the moon on the 21st,” the ship’s captain, Roger Stuping told the Florida Times. Indeed, amongst the rotting corpses of fat rich Americans and terminally greyed zombies who make up the ship’s clientele, the sound of a warbling Bonnie, screaming away may even give some of them a mortal zing in their pacemakers. “Last time I saw Bonnie Tyler, was in 1983, I was watching MTV when she came on the screen. I’ve never seen a cat curl up and die in front of me before,” one music fan revealed. Astronomers however are fearful that Bonnie Tyler’s singing could cause grave events up in the heavens. Professor Donald Eastwick, a renowned astronomer, revealed that Tyler could cause a “rift in the time continuum plasma shift index with her high frequency sine waves causing the moon to shift its gravitational matrix field and shoot into space like a wayward billiard ball”.'], ['Kim Jong-un ‘No Longer Seen as God’ By North Koreans', '“He’s nothing but a low down mangy festering puss puss,” one man dared to say before he was carted off to one of North Korea’s infamous gulags. In a communist country where every facet of ones lives is carefully scripted and watched, the North Korean leader is no longer seen as a living God. “When I was at school we were taught that our supreme leader was so amazing he could literally fly. Kim Jong-un visited our school once, and when he walked through the door of our classroom he tripped over and fell onto the floor farting at the same time. If anyone laughed it would be over for us, so we shut up. He’s just a fat gaseous idiot,” Wong Suk, 16, a former pupil revealed on pain of death. The funny thing is the North Korean despot is putting anyone who sees who he really is into gulags or having them murdered. Some North Koreans have even taken to religion, which is strictly prohibited in the communist state. There are rumours that many would rather believe in the Jesus myth, than Kim, and that really pisses him off. CIA analyst, Berndt Gerhardt, revealed in a recent paper that believing in Christian stories like Jesus walking on water, and turning water into wine was preferable to believing that Kim Jong-un flies around the skies at night and has super God powers that Karl Marx or Lenin would have died for. “Yes, some North Koreans despite their brainwashed state, would rather believe in ridiculous bible stories than the fact that Kim Jong-un is a supreme being who can literally fart out missiles from his fat pimply ass hole and flatten the Trump tower 6,500 odd miles away,” the analyst revealed.'], ['Wiping Out History: The Charlottesville Communist Agenda', 'General Robert E. Lee H istory should be seen, it should be analysed, it should be taught to children, and it most of all should be celebrated good or bad. With calls from extreme left wing groups to erase historical statues like General Robert E. Lee, in Charlottesville, there is a similarity to the case of the Cecil Rhodes statue in Oxford university, England. According to Charlottesville city officials, the removal of the General E. Lee statue from the park will cost taxpayers over $700,000. This does not include the cost of policing the mass protests against the removal of such an iconic part of American history which are costing taxpayers millions. The extreme left communistic factions are acting like fascists themselves, they are censoring history, something akin to what went on in the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984. Naturally, those who oppose the defiling of historical artefacts and statues are labelled as nazis, or fascists by the communists. Any sort of attempt at preservation of historical artefact today is thus labelled as fascism. This is wrong. History should not be erased, it should be preserved whichever political spectrum you come from. ISIS has been erasing history in the Middle East with their purge on priceless irreplaceable ancient archaeology. This is the level the Sovietized leftists are at now. In military history, General E. Lee was a great leader and strategist. The editing of history is a huge crime and is Stalinistic in its approach, as well as Hitlerite. The people who want historical statues torn down are troglodytes not worthy of a school visit to a museum. Such blinkered attitudes should not exist within a supposed enlightened civilised era yet here we are today with the Soviet left agitators on one side and the preservationists on the other. We are now living in an era where the so-called left are acting like fascists and the so-called right conservationists are acting with dignity and decency. If you erase history it will continue repeating ad infinitum.'], ['Juncker Planning Trip to Moon 124 Billion Euros One Way', 'Here is a guy who does not mind spending 500,000 euros in two months of travel, so the trip to the moon should be no problem. “The Commission never pays for anything, it is the EU taxpayer that foots the bill. Therefore, I am fully justified to travel to the moon if I so do wish,” the EU president, Jean Claude Juncker told Euronews. The European Space Agency have already crafted a luxury space vehicle for Juncker and his assorted hangers on. Michele Poisson, chief engineer for the project revealed some of the intricacies of the moon trip: “We have designed the perfect craft for Mr. Juncker and the many young ladies who will accompany him on the EU mission. In the dining area, the best French chefs will prepare the finest cuisine for the trip, and we have of course the bar area, where the collection of finest cognac will be filtered into Juncker’s space suit via a large tube. Once through the Van Allen Belt, the drunkard Juncker will be given coordinates to the moon but if he punches the wrong digits, this could mean a trip to Mars instead, Ooh la la, we do not want such things, mes amis, instead maybe I should programme an automatic flight so our president can enjoy the lovely fruits of the jeune folies and his booze in peace.” Whilst the president is away, the EU will be run by one of the faceless unelected eurocrats, and it will make no difference any way, as Juncker barely does any work when he is on earth, let alone on a spacecraft to the moon. Landing on the moon is scheduled for Mid September, and once on the surface, a luxury pod will be built by some Romanian builders who will be also transported to the surface in a separate craft. “The oxygen supply is limited, and Mr. Juncker is very flatulent so we do worry about the build-up of methane. Hopefully the oxygen will not run out and they all suffocate to death, this would be an absolute tragedy, not only for the EU, but the cognac business,” Mr. Poisson added.'], ['Disney Streaming Another Nail In Hollywood Coffin', ' Hollywood has been left floundering as their sales drift in the wind. Disney streaming on the internet will certainly fill a niche market, however the whole Disney repertoire is available to stream for free right now on the internet. The same goes for any series, film or documentary you have ever heard of. It’s all out there to be watched and streamed for free, from the putlocker, to the 123movies to whatever name they’re calling themselves after being shut down on one server, and moving to another. The servers are most probably in China somewhere, and cannot be shut down as no such thing as copyright exists in the Chinese mindset or law. “Thanks to the free movie streaming sites. I’ve watched pretty much every film there is in history and frankly I’m bored now. I watch films now a few weeks before they’re released in the UK. Like the other day I was walking in the street and saw a bus with a sign for a film that I saw three weeks ago streamed online for free in full HD quality. So, the reasoning here is, why should I pay ten quid to get a ticket and another eight for some popcorn and a drink? Exactly!” some guy said from outside an empty cinema somewhere in London. It’s a mystery how Hollywood funds its films these days or brings in new talent, especially with millions of people on the streaming sites watching away for free. Film executive, Elmer Johnson, told the LA Times: “We just make safe bet films these days with the same old stars. That’s the only way to break even. Superhero movies, remakes of remakes of remakes, some rom coms for the ladies, and cutesy animated movies, ya know, talking penguins and sausages. If we make a movie without major realistic looking high end expensive shit CGI action it’s a flopper. Remember that kids these days have an attention span of about 3.5 seconds. If something big does not happen quick, they switch off so we have to make massive explosions, car crashes and more explosions. Fight scenes, heck we have to make them so fast that you don’t know what’s happening, not like real life where ya get the guy swinging that long arm you can see from space, we’re talking nanosecond Jason Bourne fights. Also, let me add, dark movies, movies filmed with minimal light so the viewer does not know what’s happening and all of this with murmured dialogue no one can understand.” Key in any film title and watch for free right now on the internet.

The eternal misappropriated child, O’Connor is always crying out for attention, and always wanting to be loved, in a world unforgiving as it is today, to make rambling videos only deepens the malaise as it brings in others who at the end of the day are no good for this constantly craving woman. The music biz, an unforgiving trench of faeces spits out artists through its continually turning meat grinder. If you show any sign of doubt, you are sucked under, a music casualty forever maligned, a shadow of a shadow, one of Satan’s rejects. If you however reach up and take the bull by the horns, then you may have some longevity. After all, what is Sinead O’Connor apart from someone who sang a Prince song sometime in the 90’s? Call it the drugs, the mental illness, the sad childhood, there’s always a blame culture embedded in the perpetual victim, and it is a vicious cycle rearing its ugly head every time the hormonal cycle turns. Sinead blames everyone and everything else apart from herself. Ripping up a picture of the Pope, was possibly the most endearing thing Sinead did, however there are a lot of brainwashed Catholics out there, and record sales did suffer after that escapade. Yes, the Catholic church is a safe place for paedophiles and other assorted monsters to conduct their evil practices without fear of reprisal, but it is also a heavily fortified institution that is followed by millions of mindless people who cannot think for themselves or formulate their own thoughts, and these morons do buy records as well. Sinead says that she only delves in the truth and honesty, however in the music biz, this can be a serious flag, and any executive will tell their artists to shut up or watch their sales plummet. So, what hope is there for Sinead, ‘stuck in the arse end of New Jersey’? Sure, she is stuck in a motel with some seriously dodgy decor, but it does look clean enough. This is the end of an artist who certainly did not play by the rules in the music biz, and many in a record company will cite her as an example of someone who just did not get it. You play the game, you listen, you get on, sell your soul, and you will get the reward if you are lucky enough, otherwise you end up like Sinead O’Connor, a sad lump of meat that’s been through the grinder, maybe three or four times. Should there be any pity for such a creature? Certainly not, for to give pity to self-pity only equals a disgusting soup of sickly mewling detritus. With someone who has had all the opportunities as O’Connor and her propensity to throw it all away every single time, there should not be an ounce of pity, but only disgust. When an artist gets to the abyss, they have two choices, either jump across or fall in.'], ['The Best Ways to Make Money in 2017', 'While 1992 may go down in history as the Queen’s Annus Horribilis, 2017 has firmly cemented itself as the world’s Annus Skintus – that’s Latin for a poor year, we’re told.

Thus, leaving you with peace of mind and the comfort that you’re providing for your family long after you’re six-feet under.'], ['Analyst: Why ISIS Was Doomed to Failure', "Don't look now Abdul but I think there is something behind you There was a time when even the mention of ISIS would bring up the fear in people, however in the last two years we have seen a massive decline in their influence as well as strategic hold in Iraq and Syria. One could postulate that ISIS, is more than just an organisation but an ideology, and some part of this thesis could be true, however if the land is not held by their soldiers, then they lose strategic value and compromise their ideology from spreading. Despite the regular servings of gruesome execution videos to social media and the internet, and some irregular attacks on Western cities, ISIS has been floundering for some time. The reason for this loss of territory, is of course the age old configuration. Without any air force, or control of the air, no military unit can ever survive long term in today’s technological age. Not only has ISIS been beaten down with US, and other Allied air supremacy but by Russian and Syrian air strikes. There is no army that can ever survive such an onslaught with capitulating territory and receiving massive losses of infrastructure and men. The loss of Mosul, and other major towns and cities in Iraq, as well as in Syria show that air supremacy is king. Without the jets, the military infrastructure to house and maintain the air forces, satellites, pilot training, vast spending on research and development, a military force is nothing but a sitting duck. Therefore, unless ISIS somehow gain these attributes, they will eventually disappear and be pushed back further into the caves and tunnels of some mountain region. Without the air, there is little or no chance for ISIS."], ['Five Millionaires Who Blew It All', 'B ut what about the complete opposite? Incredible stories of people who seemingly ‘have it all’, flying high with the private jets, the mansions and all the trimmings of the rich and powerful, until… Take a look at the following five stories of the 1%, who took an almighty fall from grace. 1. MC Hammer Rappers have a reputation for spending money faster than they can earn it, and that’s exactly what happened to our friend MC Hammer. While hitting the big time and earning hundreds of millions of dollars on a stellar music career might encourage us to blow off some steam, I doubt many of us would splurge on TWO private helicopters, y’know, just in case one’s in the shop…word on the street is that he owes over three quarters of a million dollars to the IRS in back taxes. We guess when it comes to his finances, you seriously can’t touch this. 2. Terence Watanabe Whatever the worst day of your life was, we would make a bet it doesn’t compare to the single day that Terence Watanabe lost $5,000,000 in one casino. As part of a year-long gambling binge, he lost $127 million in 12 months, between two Casinos in Vegas alone. That’s a whopping amount of money to blow. Makes me feel a lot better about weak spot for the major millions slot game. Ouch!! However, before we feel too sorry for him, his bets that year totalled $825 million, helping him become a Vegas tourist attraction in and of himself. 3. Allen Stanford Everybody loves a villain, and one of the most public millionaire shamings of all time has to be Allen Stanford’s infamous Ponzi scheme. Stanford, and his company The Stanford Financial Group donated millions to politicians around the globe, notably in Antigua and America. Worth hundreds of millions of dollars, who could have known that he was paying back investors with new investments from elsewhere? In 2012, Stanford was arrested by the FBI, sentenced to a life sentence of 110 years, and slapped with a fine of more than $12 billion. 4. Nicolas Cage Nicolas Cage might be one of the world’s most recognisable actors, but he also declared bankruptcy in 2009. While he was once worth a pretty hefty $150 million, he clearly has a history of somewhat odd purchasing decisions. His buying habits tend towards the ridiculous, from a collection of shrunken heads to a 67 million year old T-Rex skull, which cost him $276,000 and turned out to be stolen property. 5. Spencer and Heidi Pratt There’s little better in life than watching smug reality TV stars get their just desserts, so when Spencer and Heidi Pratt, of The Hills fame announced that they had garnered a $10,000,000 fortune from basically making fools of themselves on television, the world waited for them to get their comeuppance. And we didn’t have to wait long. Around 2010, the Montag money began to run dry, and in 2012, Spencer admitted that Heidi believed an asteroid was going to hit Earth on December 21st 2012, giving them no reason to hold onto their fortune. Spoiler alert: It didn’t happen, sending ‘Speidi’ back to live with dear old Mom and Dad in financial ruin. So there you have it folks. The advice you can draw from this is seemingly limitless. If you find yourself in possession of tens of millions of dollars, try not to gamble it all away in the space of 12 months, ‘invest’ it in priceless stolen relics which remind you of Jurassic Park, or throw it all away in fear of the apocalypse. You’re welcome.'], ['The British Movie Star You WON’T Want to Work For', 'T his must-see commercial, was essentially designed to show that PlayOJO is not like traditional online casinos and is a fairer brand that benefits players by – among other advantages – giving them money back on every bet. The 30 second spot, features Bell in the starring role as a disgruntled employee of the casino who is infuriated that the company would give money back to players on every bet because that’s not how a casino is run. He quits on the spot in a rage, biting a pen in half and spitting it out before storming out of the office. He looks around at his fellow former team members and growls, showing ink-stained teeth. He then proceeds to make a spectacle of himself on his way out of the workplace, by stapling a plush toy to a pillar and crushing a sandwich in his hands. The commercial is as only as good as it is because Bell is a master of role playing. His rugged looks, commanding presence and comedic actions and expressions is what injects life into the scene. In the commercial, he literally transforms into a volatile boss you wouldn’t want to work for. You know, the one you’d be afraid to look at the wrong way or share an opinion with. That guy. Of course, it’s not just commercials that bring out the best in this lesser-known movie star. Geoff Bell is a respected and skilled British actor who has been in the film industry for nearly three decades. He has an amazing ability to take on difficult roles and really make them his own. What’s more, for being a lesser-known actor in Hollywood, the man has starred in some pretty big movies. The most recent (and terrible) King Arthur film from Guy Ritchie aside, Bell has been a part of many incredible movies and television shows. When it comes to major blockbuster films, he typically makes a cameo appearance or has a minor supporting role. You can find him in movies like Girl with the Pearl Earring, RocknRolla, Stardust, Making Waves, The Business, War Horse, Scoop, and Rogue One. That said, if you really want to see Bell in all his glory, you need to check out one of his best known films, Green Street Hooligans. The 2005 movie is about a Harvard undergrad who moves to London after being wrongfully expelled and encounters a violent underworld of football hooliganism. Geoff Bell plays Tommy Hatcher, the rival of the main characters played by Elijah Wood and Charlie Hunnam. Other notable roles for Bell include playing the captain of England’s football team, Gary Wackett, in the 2001 film, Mike Bassett: England Manager. The character was a parody of Stuart Pearce and was known as Wacko in the movie for being a violent centre back. Bell also starred in the popular 2015 action-adventure comedy, Kingsman: The Secret Service. He played Dean Baker, the abusive stepfather of the film’s protagonist Gary “Eggsy”, played by Teron Egerton. Even though Bell did the role justice, unfortunately, he won’t be returning in the movie’s sequel, due out later this year. As you can see, Geoff Bell tends to be cast in dark, dangerous and villainous roles, which is what made him a no-brainer choice for OJO’s commercial.'], ['Scaramanga Vows to Get Back at Trump After White House Firing', '“I have invited Donald to my little secluded island off the coast of China for a duel to the death. I have a very special surprise for the Teflon Don, Nick Nack will greet him when he lands on the beach, and the deadly duel will start from there, of course only after a brief civilised luncheon,” the fired communications director, Scaramanga revealed on Tuesday. Apart from being a deadly shot, Scaramanga also has a distinctive extra appendage to wow the ladies with. “Yes, I have three nipples, it is a sign of greatness, and I also pride myself in being a paranoid schizophrenic.” The President, who was instrumental in the firing of Scaramanga says he has accepted the invitation to the secluded island only on the proviso that he gets to take Goodnight with him back to the White House as his new plaything.

The dude just didn’t care one iota,” general manager for a tire manufacturing company in Wisconsin told his local newspaper. The drug of choice is a cheap opioid called Fentanyl, one hundred times more potent than morphine, imported from Chinese drug factories working 24/7 shifts to ship to the good ol’ US of A. Another employer for a garden tools company in Minnesota would come into work some days and find his employees floating in the ceiling area. “I’d have to get one of our rakes to get these fellas down. Some were so far gone that a pitchfork in the rear barely got a reaction.” Many economists blame the drug craze on the loss of manufacturing jobs outsourced to Chinese factories, and if this is the case, it means that not only is China raking in huge profits from manufacturing sub-standard cheap goods for the U.S. market, but they’re actually poisoning the American work force with cheap opioid drugs. The former president, Barack Obama, also legalised marijuana use in many states, and it is well documented that smoking weed slows people down. “I smoke two joints for breakfast, then move onto the couch. That’s when I start rollin’ all day long,” another unemployed man told newspapers. Federal Reserve Chair, Janet Yellen has proposed a cure for the drugged up American population. “We need to counteract opioid drugs with picker uppers. Like say for example I took two pills of Fentanyl, well I need to counteract that with some crack cocaine, a smidgeon of pcp, some meth, four lines of coke, and glass of cold water poured over my face. Then I’ll be workin’ like a motherfucker. We need speed, speedie Gonzalez, have those racks of hub caps polished in under a minute, stack those garden tools in thirty seconds, you know what I mean, sniff?”'], ['Arsenal – Dare to Dream of November', 'B ut, if the past as told us anything the gunners will be wrapping-up their season by November. As Charlie Eccelshare, writing for the Daily Telegraph says “As the clocks go backwards at the end of October each year, so invariably do Arsenal.” But why? When historically their best months are September and October, do the gunners never seem to make it unscathed past that all important November? Don’t run so fast, you might fall down As October draws to a close, you can imagine the mums and grandmas of our favourite football heroes sitting them down for a good talking to. Think about last year’s’ injuries in November alone, including Oxlade-Chamberlain, Wilshere, Ramsey, Rosicky, Walcott, Arteta and Ospina. This led to Per Mertesacker calling the team “a bit knackered” after they struggled into a draw against Spurs. In the last 10 seasons, they have suffered no fewer than 80 – yes 80 November injuries. You can see why their parents might be wishing they had joined the chess club at this point in time. Don’t look directly at them Let’s call a spade a spade, the other reason why November is a cursed month for those Arsenal boys, is that they keep being put up against, er… better teams. Y’know, the ones who seem to win the league every year. Whether it’s Chelsea, Man City or Man United, Spurs or Liverpool, these all seem to come up in November, and they just can’t seem to hack it. In the last ten years, aside from the 2011 season, they have faced one of these teams in November without exception. In 2011, their points per game hit a November high of 2.33, in comparison to their usual November average of 1.59. With all this info at hand, it’s probably a bit worrying that this November sees them facing Manchester United, Tottenham, and Manchester City. I certainly won’t be whipping out my phone and using my sky bet android app to bet against the odds. It’s too late for 2017, but maybe they can request to go up against some really bad teams for November 2018, that should sort that darned curse out once and for all. “Hello, Sunderland? It’s Arsene Wenger here. Small favour to ask…” 2017 Season But all jokes aside, the real question is, can Arsenal keep their head above water this November to remain serious contenders for the Premier League? Or are they doomed to keep repeating the same mistakes? If Arsenal have any chance to do something different they have to keep Alexis Sanchez happy but after missing the first game with Leicester with an abdominal strain, and the rumours circling that he is not long with the team, it doesn’t look great. That, coupled with the seasons low projections for them, estimating that they will do at best fourth, encourages fans to lose support from the get-go. It’s going to be an uphill climb for our boys in red and white, and at this point, it would be a huge surprise if they managed to pull a brilliant November out of the bag. But hey, who doesn’t love surprises?'], ['Dunkirk: Triggered Feminist Wants More Women Fighting in WW2 Films', 'A triggered feminist reacts to a male during a rally “My main issue with Dunkirk is that it’s so clearly designed for men to man-out over,” Mehantara Boner, who writes in some woman’s magazine whines, adding, “The packaging of the film, the general vibe, and the tenor of the people applauding it just screams “men-only”. In her staunch feminist article, Boner has called for all World War II films to import women fighting in the front lines to show equality. Although this would not be historically accurate, the writer says that having “female platoons in Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal and Dunkirk, would make the films more accessible to women, instead of just showing men fighting and being male-like”. Even though millions of men sacrificed their lives in both world wars, this is not enough for modern feminists who become triggered by images of men fighting on boats and beaches. “Like look at Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg should have put Scarlett Johannsen somersaulting out of the landing craft on D-Day, dodging bullets whilst shooting thousands of Germans in their parapets, then helping male soldiers with their wounds simultaneously laying down suppressing fire all the while applying another pristine lacquer polish to her nails as she brings out the bangalores.” “Dunkirk felt like an excuse for men to celebrate maleness—which apparently they don’t get to do enough. Fine, great, go forth, but if Nolan’s entire purpose is breaking the established war movie mold and doing something different—why not make a movie about women in World War II?” Boner continues whining. “What about the Pacific, in the jungles, they were all male soldiers fighting and in the films, that is all you see. Why could the directors not put in female role models onto the battle scenes with the Japs? Again, we could see Wonder Woman characters jumping into battle as bullets cut down the men. The females would of course be immune to bullets and karate kick their way through whole Japanese platoons with not so much of a sweat.” For feminists, the hatred of men is so great that they cannot even stand the thought of seeing the sight of male sacrifice on the battlefield. This is what men have done for centuries, yet the modern feminist is disgusted by this, they do not understand that if it were not for these brave young men fighting and sacrificing themselves on the beaches and in the jungles for the Allies these women would probably not have the freedom to write their claptrap anti-male clickbait nonsense today. It would be a beautiful and just day to see how these feminists would cope in such a hostile battlefield, on Omaha beach, on Peleliu island, as the bullets whiz around them, and the bombs rip bodies apart. To see your buddies legs blown off in front of you, the blood soaked sand, slipping on entrails and blown out brains. It is most certain they would not last three seconds in a real battlefield scenario.'], ['AA Chief Falls Off Cliff', 'Mr Mackenzie held the roles of chief executive and chairman at the London-listed roadside assistance company. “We fired him for gross misconduct. We found him wandering the halls of the main HQ building only in his underpants with a woman’s bra over his head talking about the ‘Jibbly Jabbly Doo’s’. He then ran into the cafeteria and forcibly took one of our dinner ladies, Irene, 74, by the hand and started dancing with her on top of the counter. After that traumatic scene, Mr Mackenzie, still talking gibberish, did not realise his scrotum was dangling below his underpants entered the boardroom where executives were hashing out an important deal with Chinese investors. The Chinese investors who were attending the meeting were not at all happy when Mackenzie picked up two pens pretending they were chopsticks, and with squinty eyes started talking about ‘Fu Manchu’ and ordering a ‘numbah 42’ as well as a ‘special flied lice’,” Chairman Steve Burrows told the Financial Times.

In about five minutes, we had a 26 foot long Great White shark swimming around the boat,” series producer, Mikey Voss, told the NY Post. What was meant to be a 100 metre race with a genuine Great White shark then turned to disaster. “Michael Phelps got on the start line and the shark was approximately three metres behind, so Phelps actually got a head start. He dived in the water and started swimming. At first, the Great White shark did nothing, then when Phelps was half way through the race, it kicked in and drew up behind him,” Voss added. As the Shark Week organisers and experts desperately tried to make the shark veer to the left of Phelps instead of following him, disaster struck. “Phelps was dragged under the water and we heard a blood curdling scream. You actually heard the crunching sound as the Great White bit down. We filmed everything, even the part when the shark’s eyes glaze over as it attacks,” cameraman, John Weiss, revealed. The Shark Week episode will be aired in September, however some parts will be excluded due to the nature of the content. Michael Phelps, who lost both legs above the knee in the attack, is still recovering. He says that he will resume his swimming career and compete in the Paralympics. “I’m just happy, Shark Week fans eventually got the footage they wanted,” Phelps said from his hospital bed.'], ['INSIGHT: Healthcare in the USA', 'American healthcare - A man sees the bill he has to pay after a four week stay in a U.S. hospital According to reports from the USA, if you get severely ill and are hospitalised, you have to pay for the treatment. For long recurring medical conditions, this can mean whole families can have their lives ruined financially ending up in the loss of their homes, as well as their lives. HOW HEALTHCARE WORKS IN AMERICA a) To afford to pay for healthcare private insurance, you have to have a high paying job to pay the large monthly costs and premiums. b) If you do not have healthcare insurance and get sick, you are shit out of luck from receiving premium treatment and are usually referred to low tier medicare which has a very long waiting list. However, you can turn up at a proper hospital and demand treatment, the hospital will usually treat you then give you a large bill at the end of your visit, bankrupting you. c) A normal treatment at a hospital which would cost you nothing in the UK, will cost Americans over $64,000. For protracted treatment, it can go up to the millions. d) Most health insurance in America does not pay for certain illnesses, so unless you take the time to read the small print (which insurers can change at any time) then you will have to pay the full cost of treatment regardless of the fact that you pay full whack for insurance. e) Don’t forget the fact that when you have health insurance and receive treatment you have to also pay an extra cost as a deductible. This sum can be quite large depending on the treatment cost and the insurers whim. f) Apart from the threat of losing your home if you get sick in America, there’s the additional threat of losing your healthcare if you lose your job. The amount of stress this causes most Americans actually makes them sick, which is in the long run good for the medical and health insurance business. g) According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2012 there were 48.0 million people in the US (15.4% of the population) who were without health insurance. h) Some Americans deliberately commit crimes so they can go to prison and receive free healthcare. i) If you are from outside the US, and travelling in the country you must make sure you have the correct travel insurance. If not, and you get sick, you will be stuck in the USA indefinitely until you pay off your vast hospital bills. j) None of the above relates to the NHS in the UK as all treatment is free.'], ['Prince Harry and William: “Let’s Open Up Another Can of Worms From Years Ago”', 'Mundus vult decipi, ergo decipiatur Y es, it’s good to talk in this millennial age, where people are urged to talk about their deepest anxieties, their deepest secrets, and their most vulnerable thoughts, but is it conducive to a royal family member to do such a thing? One must remember that the royals have a multitude of enemies lurking in the shadows waiting to pounce on the tiniest crack or tiniest of vulnerabilities to be exploited. Prince Harry, not the brainiest chap in the world wants to tell everyone about his mental issues, especially regarding the death of his mama, and then comes Prince William later on saying a few words here or there about his issues, however what may have been an innocent looking confession will now come back as a large bite. Already the gutter press are getting ready to post those ‘lost’ Diana tapes where she speaks to her voice coach. The people posting the videos are citing Harry and William’s need to talk as the reason for them dredging up this soon to be money making video. The damage to the royals will thus be another plunging knife into the monarchy and its rotting sarcophagus. Pont d’Alma Temple de Diana If Harry and Wills knew the truth, of which they must suspect, about how their mother was dispatched, they would nonetheless be not so keen to air their dirty laundry in front of everyone. We will never know why all traffic cameras were mysteriously switched off in Paris on the night of Diana’s death, and why she was kept in the tunnel where the crash occurred for over three hours whilst the hospital was less than a mile away. As for the driver, who was an MI6 asset, we will never know why he slammed the car into a pillar or any other detail research theorists have dredged up. The fact that Diana was to marry a Muslim Egyptian and was pregnant with Dodi Fayed’s child will not be revealed any time soon either. How could the Windsors ever carry on with this stuff going on in front of them and blasted around the world news, where the Princes mother had mixed with Arab blood? There is no question that this state of affairs was intolerable to the royal family and something had to be done sharpish. The princes thus need to learn to keep a dignified silence if they wish to keep their places. All this self indulgent nanny talk is useless and only hurts their own interests, as well as the British monarchy.

Such a pathetic waste of time and money has already been spent on watered down talks, on Project Fear and on placating the unelected EU technocrats who rule over every facet of our lives. Is this justice, is this how Britain does things? When the majority of the population voted to get completely out of the EU, that is what we meant, there can be no middle way, or hankering to the Commission. Unfortunately we now have a Brexit team ruled by Remainers like Philip Hammond, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who puts a spanner in the works to every step forward a Brexiteer makes. With real Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg locked out of Brexit proceedings, the watering down continues much to the celebration of pro-EU lobby. The Prime Minister, is complicit in this betrayal of the people, and the sickening walk backwards into the EU quagmire.

Plus, I’ve just built a fourth garage at the mansion and the Bugattis will be delivered soon.” Next year the TV licence tax may rise to £260/annum to compensate for the ridiculous sums involved paying people who either simply read from an autocue or roughly shout into microphones in the morning after playing a few poorly chosen records. Impartial BBC Controller, Edgar Evans, was adamant that the TV licence will have to rise in the new year as salaries rose incrementally. “It’s not just the stars of the BBC who receive large sums of taxpayer funded money, but behind the scenes, controllers like me take home pay packets that are quadruple of what was published yesterday. Yes, it’s all thanks to the dumb licence fee payer, anyone with any gumption or conscience would have refused to pay the licence tax years ago, but there are millions of idiots in this country who are too brainwashed too care.

Because of the stringent rules in Saudi Arabia where women have to cover every part of their bodies, many men are so starved of the female flesh that they start seeing things. “Forget about seeing an oasis in the desert, in Saudi Arabia, seeing a scantily clad woman walking in front of you is hundred times more desirable,” one witness revealed on Wednesday. Another witness recalled the events when walking through the ancient deserted city of Ushayqir: “I was walking in the midday sun, thirsty and lost. Somehow I lost my map, when all of a sudden out of the sand came this vision. I could even smell her perfume which she dabbed over her milky pale thighs from 50 yards. Her legs were magnificent and she daintily skirted through the deserted streets, I was compelled to follow her like a moth towards a light bulb, and as the sun beat down on my head relentlessly I forgot where or who I was. Turning a corner, suddenly she was gone, I looked up and she had led me to the main road where a few shops and restaurants resided. She saved me, as I was dehydrated.” Despite the mysterious woman being called a mirage, thousands of desperate Saudi men are now flocking to the area for their chance to sight her. “It is almost like a pilgrimage, but not out of religion, only testosterone,” another man revealed.'], ['Does the New Swift Initiative Represent the Future of Travel?', 'I t was Margaret Thatcher who was once reported to have opined that anyone who travelled by bus beyond the age of 26 could be considered as a failure in life, and this reflects both the nature of her tenure and the negative way in which public transportation was once perceived. Buses and trains have evolved considerably during the last two decades, however, with the emergence of touchscreen kiosks and smart technology playing a central role in this change. Thanks to various collaborations between travel and technology brands, public transportation is now entering a brave new era. The latest example has seen UK touchscreen kiosk company cammaxlimited.co.uk launch the ITSO SMART ticketing initiative at various points throughout the UK, as part of a six month pilot project that will change the nature of travel in Britain. The ITSO SMART Initiative: Why and How Will it Change Public Transport in the UK? Essentially, the new project has been launched to satisfy the rising demand for self-service retail points at train and bus stations nationwide. The initiative itself has been pioneered by Cammax in collaboration with Transport for West Midlands (TfWM), which is a vast and influential public authority that governs the organisation of travel in the UK. At its heart are Swift Kiosks, the first of which has been in action at Wolverhampton Bus Station since April. These touchscreen and intuitive kiosks will offer an easy-to-use interface to travellers, while enabling them to access various products, tickers and travel cards that are relevant to their region. These include Swift Pay As You Go tickets and season tickets for buses, trains and even trams. The Swift Kiosks will also offer access to multi-day travel passes and e-Daysavers, while passengers will have the unique opportunity to leverage any real-time promotions and regional discounts that are active at the time of purchase. It will be possible for travellers to top-up their smart cards from these kiosks, establishing each one as a one-stop platform from which you can manage your trips and daily commute. The kiosks will also ensure that individual products and top-up services are available from 24-hours from physical locations, creating a more convenient and seamless experience for customers across the board. The Last Word for UK Travellers There is no doubt that consumers are becoming increasingly accustomed to smart technology, and this is beginning to influence their expectations across a host of experiences and activities. In this respect, the launch of the ITSO SMART pilot and the installation of Swift kiosks in Wolverhampton have come at the ideal time, while creating an accessible and technology-led solution that can bring public transportation in the UK kicking and screaming into the 21st century. With relevance for both existing and new customers, these new kiosks can serve multiple consumer needs at the touch of a button while contributing to a quicker, more efficient enjoyable travel experience. In conjunction with the Swift App, this should ultimately lead to higher levels of customer satisfaction and increase boarding times, ultimately easing the burden on operators in the process. With the potential for further roll-outs and innovation throughout the year, this could be the beginning of a brand new dawn for travel in Britain.'], ['Jacob Rees-Mogg: Soft Brexit Means No Brexit', 'The meddling traitorous Remainers within the Conservative party as well as the Labour party are treacherously trying to derail Brexit. The Brexit vote by the people on June 23, 2016, will probably not be delivered as there are many traitors in Britain who would gladly sell the country down the river to our enemies. Britain’s enemies within We have a Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, who puts a spanner in the works at every turn, we have numerous Remoaners, like Nicky Morgan who are given preference over real Brexiteers, like Jacob Rees-Mogg, and we have the treachery of former Labour PM, Tony Blair, sticking his foul stench into every part of the negotiations. The horrible reality is that this fucking traitorous anti-British shister, Hammond, might even take over from lame duck Theresa May. The elements of treason are thus stronger than the Brexit contingent, who seem to have been sidelined in the political wilderness. Where is Nigel Farage? He spouts on LBC, but what can that do? In this hour of need, we do not need mere words, we need fucking action. Where’s IDS? He does pop his head out sometimes with a good word to say about Brexit but is it enough? What happened to Michael Gove? He unfortunately is a switcher, and goes from one end to another in a second. First he was for a Brexit, and now he is for a Soft Brexit, i.e. a Brexit in name only, and has even gone as far as to say he wants Labour to get involved in negotiations. What happened to Boris Johnson? He has fled the parapet, and is now resolved to a cushy job of International flight, luxurious hotel rooms, and top totty delivered to his rooms after the day’s business has concluded. Brexit is thus furthest from his mind, as he digs in deep to the lovely dollies delivered to his door every night. The only Brexiteer that is visible in parliament at the moment is Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has been left out by Theresa May and her Remainer team, but is surely a true contender to take over from the current ailing PM if there ever were a leadership contest. Amongst all the mixed messages, the atrocious reportage by the main stream media amounting to nothing but Remoaner propaganda and Project Fear, there is a real fatigue building up about Brexit, and this fatigue is what the Remoaners are counting on. Brexit fatigue must be fought with all our might if Britain is to get out of this unholy mess. In the words of Rees-Mogg: “Soft Brexit means remaining within the European Union, it means rejecting what voters said on June 23, 2016. “It is just a code word they use because they don’t want to admit that they’re trying to punish the electorate.”'], ['The Castration of Islam by Europe', ' “The Christian church now accepts homosexuality, transgenders, and all other facets of bestial behaviour originally condemned by the Holy Bible. The book of Christianity has been defiled by the progressive liberal clergies who see fit to add anything they wish with their socialist inclusive culture. The Christian church and religion is now overrun by sodomites, paedophiles and other satanic elements. What do you think we will do to Islam, who the EU and UK wishes to change, to subjugate, to alter in a Western way?” a Christian Arch Deacon, revealed in a recent communique about the role of Islam in the West. The Syrian crisis has seen refugees coming from all over the Middle East into the EU zone. These millions of predominantly Islamic refugees bring with them a religion that is wholly incompatible with Western liberal values. “In the West we drink alcohol, we eat pork flesh, we do not mutilate our genitals through circumcision or FGM, we enjoy drugs, adultery is accepted as a part of life, we enjoy pornography everywhere, our women dress scantily in public and are not ashamed of nudity and feminism is encouraged. We live in a Western promiscuous society where every sexual fetish is celebrated, where sodomites and lesbians have their own festivals, where transgenderism is seen as normal, we love debt, we have no morality when it comes to bombing countries where Muslim people live to take their resources and embed our forces deep in their territory. “Your Islamic religion is against all of that, but our role is to subvert your religion, to Westernise it, to water it down so it will too become a reformed, rewritten liberal religion. We will use those who have come to Europe as examples, their core religion will be watered down Islam, let us say that all that is haram, will be permitted soon, and the Muslims in Europe now are subscribing in their millions to our version of the new European Islam. “Today, the original Christian Ten Commandments are all permitted to be broken by the liberalised church, and so we have turned our eyes onto the Holy Quran. It will take some years, through the European mosques and through daily European indoctrination, but we will convert you to our ways sooner than later.” Emasculation of Islam The massive feat to change Islam so that all Western values are accepted may take many years, however Muslims who live in the West are targets for change day in day out and cannot escape from the constant indoctrination around them. “It is akin to water dripping on a stone. That water droplet after centuries creates a large hole in the rock, and this is what we are doing to the Muslims trapped in the EU. Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor has seen it upon herself to mould the Muslims with progressive Christian socialist values. Already, there are many Muslims in Germany who are adopting full Western lives, including all the vices and evils prohibited by Islam. “Within generations, Islam in Europe will be nothing but name, as the Quran itself will be altered to accept the things the Christians are accepting. The only part of Islam left in the world will be in Middle Eastern countries which are under conditions of perpetual war engineered by the Christian Western allies. Our role in the West is to change Muslims living in the West to adopt our ways, and we will do this through indoctrination over time, and to decimate Muslims living in the Middle East through war, so that their religion will not continue further. “In the West today, those prescribing to the actual tenets of the Quran are the ones who are persecuted whilst those who seek to subvert Islam’s pure form are encouraged and given great publicity when doing so.” In retrospect, there is cause for concern, as the Europeanised version of Islam, an extreme watered down liberalised religion is already flourishing in the West with gay Muslims getting married and many other vices forbidden by Islam flourishing. This does not bode well for a religion that is said to be cast in stone, and defended vigilantly by only a few remaining Muslims in the Middle East.'], ['Top Tips to Consider When Renovating Your Home', 'W hether it’s fixing up a room or two around the house in creative ways or even taking on a much bigger project and overhauling your home entirely there is always something to do for the budding fixer-uppers out there. Thousands of homes up and down the country are either renovated or have extensions added each year in the UK so it’s clear that homeowners are always keen to carry out improvements and here are a few useful tips that should help keep you on the right track. PICKING THE RIGHT PROJECT One of the most crucial aspects of any project is often based on necessity. Is it a project that needs carrying out? And if so, then what is the best way to approach it? If you’re thinking of adding an extension to your home then try to weigh up all the options before you rush into the job. Research the best way forward and look at other homes in the area that may have already had extensions put in. Knowing all the relevant details and plans relating to any restructuring of this kind is vital. BUYING AND SELLING If you happen to be buying or selling a property, especially if it’s an old house, it’s key to fork out for a full structural survey and you can get some advice on how to go about surveys via the impartial Money Advice Service. This survey could throw up a number of things that would need to be addressed and could help guide you in how to proceed with certain renovation-related tasks. This could include roof repair, upgrading the central heating, rewiring the home or even taking care of more important structural concerns. SHOULD YOU REPAIR OR REPLACE? If you’re are renovating a very old period property then the likelihood is that certain things around the house will have fallen into disrepair over the years; this particularly applies to windows and doors. Many period homes have character features like sash windows and original French doors, that can become damaged over time. The debate centres around whether or not these should be restored or replaced and both options should be carefully considered. It’s no secret that original features can add significant value to your home so unless it’s unavoidable the best option would be to try and restore them. However, approach with caution because if you attempt to fix problems yourself then you could cause further damage. The best approach would be to hire a specialist like fortishooke.co.uk who offer unique sash window restoration services or you can find other restoration businesses online. KEEPING PLANS REALISTIC More often than not developers can often fall into the trap of over-planning and making things too complicated. You may have ambitious plans but you need to keep things realistic. Factor in budgetary requirements and take into consideration how this work could affect your normal living situation in the home whilst work is being carried out.'], ['How Is Virtual Reality Affecting the Gaming Industry?', 'M oreover, this won’t just affect the gameplay of regular video games but is also expected to highly influence the online gambling world. In fact, online casino play will feel the same as playing in a land-based casino with other players, and a dealer in front of you, except you’ll be at home wearing VR glasses. Many casino sites, like Simba Games UK, are already gearing up for the introduction of VR technology to the mass market that is set to completely change the online gambling industry (and probably hurt the brick and mortar casinos.) But, before we scratch the surface of this topic, for those who are not familiar with Virtual Reality, here is a brief guide to the basics of this technology. So-called “Virtual Reality Modelling Language” (VRML) was first introduced to the world in 1994. Since then, the progress in this field had an amazing exponential growth, and today Virtual Reality is becoming an integral part of everyday life and activities. A wide range of fields has already merged with it to improve or modify some components for achieving better results. For example, one can come across VR technology in healthcare and therapy managements, military, space and medical training, fine arts, engineering, etc. How Virtual Reality Emerged With Gaming Virtual Reality is currently side by side with the gaming industry and, part of the reason for this happening is that the VR industry tends to change the way how people interact with computers and different types of gaming consoles, which can be considered as a huge step forward in this interaction. All current games involve the player on the one hand and the fictional main character on the other, who gets controlled by the player using a variety of control pads or sticks (commonly referred as joysticks). But, in Virtual Reality, the player becomes that main character and gets immersed into the game. Through Research and Development (R&D), new and modern Virtual Realities are being tested and produced, that can stimulate our organism, influencing all our human senses, so a player completely becomes an integral part and the crucial component of the game itself. The fact that tells the best how fast is the growing tempo of the VR technology is that the global Virtual Reality gaming market size was estimated at USD 4.29 Billion in 2015. That is a result of one of the newest trend in the electronic games industry – use of crowdfunding by start-ups in the VR for developing innovative software and accessories (for example Oculus VR, Sony’s Morpheus Project VR, etc.). Gambling In the VR World The progress of Virtual Reality didn’t bypass the online gambling industry, mostly because of the new way of interaction between a bettor and the gambling machine of any kind. In 2016, the Slots Million Casino company designed the first ever virtual casino. It quickly became one of its main attractions, since casino slots, as offered by Prime Slots, are by far the most popular online casino game. Players who tried this VR casino had only positive impressions about how this technology makes gambling even more enjoyable. The brick and mortar casino experience is becoming more expensive. Especially in Las Vegas, mega casino operators are trying to cut costs on the expense of the players, even cancelling the long standing Free Drinks policy, as explained in this article, it makes more sense to gravitate toward the virtual experience. Still, there are benefits for the casino too. Several types of research have shown that players spend more time playing and tend to keep on playing more frequently with VR involved. Are There Any Downsides? And the last, but not the least, one ethical problem regarding the conjugation of Virtual Reality and gaming, is the common addiction problem. The very nature of today’s games is that they tend to be hyper-addictive, which is already a global issue. But, with the incorporation of the VR technology, according to some psychologists and scientists, as well as the actual research that is being conducted on some of the leading universities, this new trend can strengthen that dependency. So the main question remains – will we tend to use Virtual Reality to enrich and to make games even more enjoyable, or will this perhaps take the wrong turn towards developing the new, stronger form of gaming addiction?'], ['Summer Transfer Window: Top Flight Spending Dubbed to Reach New High', 'We’ve seen some weird transfers in recent years, and this one seems no different! We have already seen a crazy number of big money moves, thus it is no surprise that the record for Premier League spending is set to be broken. We’ve seen Swansea star Gylfi Sigurdsson valued at £50million, with the Jacks rejecting a £30million bid from Everton. The Toffees are certainly reaping the rewards of having a new owner with Ronald Koeman having spent £90million. Then again, Everton did receive £90million from Manchester United for forward Romelu Lukaku. With this, Rafa Benitez cannot be blamed for describing the current window as “a little bit crazy”. Spending in the Premier League has already exceeded the £500million mark since the conclusion of the season. Last summer, a total of £1.165billion was spent, with that figure rising to £1.38billion following the January window. Hyper-inflation, according to football finance expert Rob Wilson, is partly to blame. This is said to mean that anyone selling to an English club is adding at least 40%, sometimes rising to 50%, to the deal. Now, a £30million transfer, such as that of Jordan Pickford’s move from Sunderland to Everton, is said to be the new norm, or at least that is the consensus of football agent Jon Smith. Business analyst Deloitte released its annual football finances last week. Records revealed that revenues of an unprecedented £3.6billion Premier League clubs in 2015-2016 were recorded. Somewhat shockingly, this was the year just before that TV broadcasting rights kick in with their new and improved payments, now that figure is expected to total the £4.5billion mark. As well as this, overall debt is continuing to fall and in coming years, it is estimated that the 20 top flight clubs combined would accumulate a profit. Ten years ago, summer spending was at £470million and that figure has now tripled, a stark indication of just how much football is growing. And this transfer window comes one year after the new TV deal kicked in, a deal worth £5.136billion and 71% more than the £3billion deal agreed in 2013. The following year after that initial deal, Lukaku made his move to Everton from Chelsea for £28million, ahead of his move to United, the forward’s fee increased some 168%. In the same year, Swansea signed Sigurdsson for an undisclosed fee, rumoured to be just shy of £7million and now, the Everton target is valued at £50million, an increase of 635%. Because of the rise in broadcast rights, revenues are continuing to rise regularly. Now, every top flight club has more money and they are willing to spend that on new recruits. Already the wealthiest league in the world, with its value forever increasing, it becomes even more attractive to commercial partners and sponsors alike. So far this window, Premier League spending is around £500million and at the same point in the last window, it stood at £340million. After Lukaku, the second biggest fee is Alexandre Lacazette’s transfer to Arsenal, coming in at £46.5million with the potential to rise to £52.6million.'], ['CNN Exclusive: Trump Had Dinner With Russians', 'Also, Trump’s son met with some Russians for a twenty minute meeting and talked about nothing much in particular. With calls to impeach president Trump just because he met with some Russian business people over dinner in 2013, there is definitely a feeling of triumphalism amongst the left-wing American press, and democrat party. “He had dinner with the Russkies in 2013. What more proof do you want that Donald Trump is working for the Russians and is a spy who flipped the elections,” one CNN reporter quipped during a newscast. The U.S. media has been buzzing with the news for the last 48 hours with constant repetitive headlines about the Trump dinner. “Yeah, it was in 2013. This proves that Trump and his sons are spying for Russia and rigged the election against Hillary Cliton,” another CNN reporter squawked. One CNN reporter even went as far as to suggest that Trump had committed ‘treason’ for enjoying dinner with the Russians back in 2013. “If he enjoyed eating the sushi whilst politely talking to the businessmen on an ongoing deal, that means it is treason and Trump should be impeached, arrested and put in the stockades.” Next week: CNN finds Russian-made paperclip in Donald Trump’s trousers and calls for more treason proceedings.'], ['End of Free Speech – Daily Squib Censored by Google Once Again', 'A s the editor of the Daily Squib from day one, our first major article that went mega global was in 2008 during the famous Obama Vs Hillary Clinton presidential contest. That article entitled ‘Ku Klux Klan Endorses Obama‘ was meant to portray a simmering in race relations, it was meant to portray a new beginning as even the racist KKK could indeed endorse a black man for president of the United States. That article was meant to portray hope in a new America where African Americans could be accepted a lot better than before. Today, we are in the year 2017, a rainy Tuesday the 11th in London, and it was much to my astonishment that I got a message from Google that one of our articles not only displayed ‘Hate Speech’ but derogatory terms and was sexually explicit. Wondering what on earth could be so offending, the answer was unbelievable. Here was an article that has been on the Google books for nearly ten years, and they are finding fault with it now? cartoon: Damien Glez http://glez.org/ The ‘Ku Klux Klan endorses Obama’ article was so huge at the the time that the Daily Squib had to be transferred to three servers to cope with the load. The story flew across America, and was all over radio stations, local tv networks, and even made it to Obama rallies where protesters held up placards proclaiming ‘Obama endorsed by KKK’. The ‘Ku Klux Klan Endorses Obama’ article was even mentioned in our Wikipedia page, as it was cited by many respected news organisations including the Sunday Times. Today is a sad day regarding the basic tenets of human expression, freedom of speech and satire. It is terribly sad to see that a company I thought championed intelligence, like Google, cannot understand simple satire, and has punished the Daily Squib needlessly for something that is an obvious misunderstanding. To take ten years to tell us that one of our key articles is a violation of your terms is in fact not only disingenuous, but wholly suspect in its nature, and malicious to boot. This nefarious action can only be viewed as anti-satire and anti-free speech. Today is a very sad day…because it means that by threatening our livelihood, Google has the freedom to censor anything it wants at any time. This is not only a gross over reach in enforcing freedom of speech but is a profound injustice to decent human relations, self expression, art and satire. This act by Google today is another nail in the coffin of internet freedom, not only because they have completely misunderstood the premise of the satirical article but they have threatened us with monetary punishment unless we take down the article. We now live in a terrible dystopian Orwellian nightmare internet world where satirical content is constantly threatened unless it is deemed kosher and fruitless, thus not making it real satire in the first place. We live in a world today where we are ruled by overseeing stasi forces that answer to no one, make up rules as they wish, have no qualms in utilising unjust methods to shut down free independent speech. quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Well done to you Google, you have taken your pound of flesh, you have exorcised the internet of one piece of satire which you completely misunderstood, and labelled incorrectly. Well done, we hope you are happy with yourselves, with your octopus grip over every facet of our lives, our every thought, our every movement. Remember ‘do not be evil’..was that not your motto once, which you have since quietly scrapped? One can only hope that one day something comes along to restore the internet to how it was before, to sweep away the pestilence and to cleanse the halls of the fermenting totalitarian corporate controlled detritus that is the internet today. Please support the Daily Squib, we are not supported by any conglomerates, publishing houses, newspapers or businesses, and are wholly independent satirical writers since 2007.

The once quaint city of Hamburg was thus reduced to a smouldering rubble heap, as the VIPs and hangers on for the G20 conference found themselves in the middle of a war zone. The strange part of the proceedings is that the communists, anarchists and Antifa legions are predominantly globalists, in the sense that they do not want borders for countries, much like the globalists in the G20 who oppose borders. Certainly, it is true that our dear friend, George Soros funds many of the groups fighting in the streets of Hamburg, and as he probably attended the G20, one wonders what goes through his mind as he looks out the window seeing these black clad apes throwing Molotov cocktails about? In retrospect, the media have been very kind to the rioters, and have calmly followed their every move in the pitch battles with police. There has been little said against the rioters, who are simply tolerated like unruly children. Had the rioters been right wing or dare we say nationalistic in their fervour, no doubt the headlines would have been less jocular, or uncaring. To this end, it can be concluded that extreme violence and property damage from the left wing is okay. From any other group, towards the right, then there is cause for concern and the rioters are not tolerated in the least. These are naturally double standards in rioting theory and should be corrected at some time in the future.

We actually never asked to be liberated and still feel great resentment. This is why we are now so close to Germany, our eternal captors, who rule over us even after the end of the great war,” Barnier told Le Monde newspaper on Thursday. Reminiscing about the good old days when troops of German Waffen SS marched up and down the Champs-Élysées, Barnier was only a child but he remembers those days with great affection in his heart. “They would come and give us sweets, chocolate at school. Then they read out a list and some kids were taken away, I think they were Jewish, but I just thought to myself, hmmm, more chocolate for me,” Barnier recalled. The German occupation of France was delightful for many French people, as the beloved Parisian architecture and boulevards were preserved from bombing, and the Nazis brought many luxury goods. The French collaborated with their captors with great ease, and this explains their endearing attitude towards Germany today. The two nations seem to be locked in some sort of sado-masochistic clinch that befuddles other allied nations. Sir Winston Churchill envisaged a liberated Europe post war scenario where France and Britain led the new Europe, instead the French rejected Britain at every level and sided with their captors Germany. A sad detrimental partnership where the abused is gladly led by the abuser. Much to the chagrin of liberators on August 25 1944, there were many French people who held a great resentment at being liberated by the American and British forces. It is a sad note that somehow explains the EU today, and how Britain, as much as it has done for France has always been shunned and denigrated.'], ['Sex Robot Prefers Washing Machine Over Human', ' “These robots are meant to adore you and only you.

Carla took one look at me, then told me I was a fat, balding, stinky human with the intelligence level of a cow, she then walked over to the washing machine and started stroking it seductively,” Baccarat recalled. Luckily, we have consumer rights so Mr. Baccarat called the store from which he purchased the robot. “They didn’t want to know. They just said the AI was working fine after a diagnostic, and that robots have their own rights too. They should be allowed to choose who they get turned on by as much as humans have a choice. This is when I took the case to the courts.” The Courts of Justice, recently filed a new law giving sex robots, and any other robot working in human households as many rights as humans. In fact, there are laws being introduced by next year, 2045, that sentient AI robots will be allowed to vote in elections, and even start their own businesses. Things are therefore not looking up for Mr Baccarat, who has now filed for his sex robot to be scrapped, but the request was emphatically denied.

To celebrate, the Queen took to her personal hangar, and plopped herself into her favourite Supermarine Spitfire, which she lovingly calls ‘Smithy’. Squadron Commander, Benson Molyneux, trained Her Majesty only last year and was astonished at her natural flying skills. “She took to the throttle like a baby does a bottle. Before we embarked on the first flight, the Queen asked if there were any Jerries we could shoot down? With a hearty laugh, I exclaimed that we could always make a sortie to Berlin or perhaps Brussels.” Merlin The Queen now flies her Spitfire whenever she feels like it, and has even taken her favourite Corgi, Willow, up into the clouds on occasion. “One likes the feel of the Spitfire, especially when one is conducting a half roll loop at 300mph at 15,000 feet. Yes, one has stalled a few times, that was during my third flight, one was rather careless with one’s elevators which are very sensitive and one brought up the control column too rapidly during a loop. The aeroplane shuddered and one heard this clitter clatter sound much like Philip’s hip joints, bringing the left wing suddenly downward. One managed to recover relatively quickly by cutting the throttle, applying opposite rudder to the spin, moving the stick forward gently until the spinning stopped, then gently applying one’s throttle to level the flight. One was very cool and measured at that point, but one nearly made a poopy in one’s panty.” image courtesy: ninj b3ta'], ['Brexit Betrayal: Theresa May Must Be Ousted By Brexiteers Immediately', ' Betrayal by Remainers With a Remainer Chancellor, Remainer PM, and Remainer negotiators in the mix, anyone who thought Brexit would ever happen is sadly mistaken. According to reports, the Remainer PM has tabled a deal so bad with the EU that Brexit might as well only happen by name. Theresa May has extended the free movement of EU citizens to five years from the EU referendum, an extension of two years. This means Britain will not be able to secure its borders by late 2020/21. The Home Office said it wanted to avoid a “cliff edge” in applications the day after Brexit, and so would grant a period of up two years’ grace for EU nationals who could demonstrate five continuous years of residence in Britain. What the new ruling would do, is create a last insurgent rush from the EU, where another million or so would enter the UK. The cut-off point should happen immediately to thwart any such rush.

Sadly, after speaking to us, a week later, Brzezinski passed away peacefully at a hospital in Virginia on the 26 May. We respectfully held off publishing the interview as a sign of respect and a period of mourning. “You ask me about the future. All I see is war and conflict. How can this be, you say? Well, it is inevitable simply because of earth’s finite resources and the massive explosion of populations, especially in the third world. Mass breeding in poor areas of the world only creates suffering, poverty, drought, unrest and pollution. The starting bell for World War III was on September 11, 2001, and since then countries have been scrambling to position themselves globally for the final showdown, the hot war, as we are entrenched in a cold, economic war through intermediaries and proxies. “The most populous country in the world, China, wants every citizen to own a car, to live like the people do in the West. We are talking about 1.4 billion people. The pollution and waste that China produces daily is at an unsustainable level already, can you think for one second what it will be like when every Chinaman gets an automobile? The only positive I can find, is that many die early in China due to environmental pollution, but still their population grows at an incredible rate. China is now deep in Africa carving up the raw resources and taking as much as they can before it is all irreparably gone. “Added to the equation, we have the United States, it makes up only 5% of the global population yet uses over 40% of the earth’s resources. We ourselves are fuelled by greed, and the need for constant growth at the expense of the rest of the globe. “The European Union is hurriedly building their own EU army to counteract Russia as well as poke it with a stick, however I feel this will be too weak, and the Russian bear could easily cut through Europe like butter in a few days. “The detestable Russia, brings forth even more certainty that war is coming, as they dig deep into Syria and the Assad regime, threatening our daily operations.

The restless Putin is preparing for a hot war (full nuclear strike) by building vast bunkers in Moscow and the Urals called the Yamantau complex, as they are prepared to absorb any strikes if need be. “It is easier to kill one million people, than it is to control them” “Meanwhile, Iran is building up its nuclear weapon arsenal with the help of the Russians and Pakistan, and it is no secret that Israel has had nuclear weapons for some time now. The purge will cleanse the Middle East of the undesirables, as the Zionists create a Greater Israel from the rubble. “I, myself, have dreamed about seeing a New World Order established after the purging of the population, we call ‘useless-eaters’. The masses today are too awakened, too politicised and frankly this makes them very dangerous. The internet has helped the masses more than the elite, to gain some kind of foothold in knowledge, and I am against the people knowing too much or them being given a voice. I will sadly not see the new cities built from the ashes and bones of the billions who will die in the coming war. “We, the masters, the elite, have found the technological prowess to survive in the future with robotic slaves and AI, instead of the human slaves we have now. The post-consumerist society will be a technological driven society where breeding will be heavily controlled. We have waited patiently to reach a certain level of technological advancement and even though we are close to the prize, we are not quite there. In the next decade, when we have created autonomous robots and life enhancing nanotechnology, the final purge will be called upon. For our future technological cities will not be able to flourish and survive with a population of poor alongside it. Our goal is to reduce the population by over 90%, one can read this manifesto in the Georgia GuideStones, where the conspiracy theorists of the internet divulge their own theories about what is written in stone. “The question always asked is which power will dominate the post-war landscape? We have the necessary technology to destroy those Russian bunkers by creating weaponry that explodes deeper into the soil and rock, and we have the technology to neutralise China, Iran and North Korea. We can even absorb a first strike, as collateral damage to us is a mere part of playing the big chess game. To lose cities like Chicago or New York is in fact a blessing, let the Russians do the work for us, the people do not matter, and they are only there as tax slaves. In the future there will not be any tax, or useless eaters. The only ones who will inhabit our future technological cities will be those who are useful to humanity. “Alas, I will not see the future cities, or watch the glorious war and purge, but I have played a part in the creation of the great work, my life is complete.” End of interview.

I didn’t think anything of it, but wondered why the water was slightly fizzy at the top. The next thing I remember is waking up in the courtroom and the judge calling a mistrial. Everything else was fuzzy, I have no recollection,” the juror visibly shaken told the Pennsylvania Times.

What is your response? Alex Jones: That makes me sadder than when I learned The Hershey Company assassinated Corey Haim because he found out they’ve been chemically engineering Jolly Ranchers to turn our children into Jihadists. Did you know that when you suck on a Jolly Ranger, you’re lapping up the Koran? Especially the cherry-flavoured ones, because “Cherry” was what Allah’s friends nicknamed him back in the day. My point being, I’m a journalist who exposes the corruption of the political-corporate-religious industrial complex. Profit is the furthest thought from my mind. Kelly: Why then did you apply to trademark the phrase FEMA Concentration Camp? Jones: To prevent the government from trademarking it first. Uncle Sam wants to imprison us and make action figures in our likeness and then sell those action figures in toy stores and then have Hollywood make a cartoon out of those figures and then a movie franchise out of those cartoons. But because I, Alexander Hamilton Jones, bought the trademark the government can’t profit off of the concentration camps, meaning the plot has been foiled. You’re welcome. On Global Warming: Kelly: Given the overwhelming scientific evidence, how in good conscience can you dismiss global warming as a myth? Jones: L.L.

It’s room-temperature smashed potatoes seasoned with the patriotic tears of a child who can’t sleep through the night because Barack Hussein Obama lives under her bed. On making English the official language of the United States: Kelly: The United States prizes its cultural diversity. With that in mind, can you appreciate the offense people take when you call for English to be the country’s official language? Jones: You gotta understand, it’s not that I don’t like people who speak the wrong languages. Just the opposite. If I didn’t like them, why would I want the government to force them to learn English? More people who speak English, more people I get to chitchat with. But I do like them, and so I want them to speak the best language. Kelly: You’re saying English is a superior language? Jones: According to the experts, yes. Language people, whatta you call ‘em, the ones who know all the lingo….lingo-ists! They say English has the most words, which means you can pray to God with more variety, which means God is more likely to listen because He hates reruns.

Marxism via communism has been responsible for the deaths of over 120 million people in the 20th century alone, and yet this dangerous ideology is flourishing amongst especially the young of Britain today. The youth have somehow fallen for one of the most malicious, evil ideologies ever created, and yet no one is doing much about it. Communism in Britain is a serious threat to our national security and must be treated the same way Britain treated the Soviets during the Cold War, only this time, large swathes of the population have been indoctrinated through clandestine Soviet techniques by the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn. Reading the words of devout Corbynistas on Twitter, you realise the extent of the problem at hand. “We must organise. Much like the Bolsheviks, we must take what is rightfully ours through violence if need be.” “There will be blood on the streets. Dissenters will be shot. Through guerilla warfare Mao was able to take power, and so can we!” “The election was rigged. Unite as one and we are unbeatable. The million man march will show them our power.” With calls from Corbyn himself to seize the homes of the rich to house migrants, one can see the dangerous mindset of this deranged communist madman. There is no doubt that Corbyn would arrange for violent action to take over the capitalist democratic state and destroy the monarchy. From Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Mao Zedong to Lenin and Stalin, all these communist dignitaries have one thing in common, they came to power through violence and warfare. Who is to say that the same will not happen in Britain? The only way a true communist regime can come into power is through revolution, which means warfare, guerilla tactics, and fighting in the streets. The first thing the communists always do is kill 40%-60% of the population. All people who might in the future get in the way of the soviet state are purged. From the base population, the hierarchy then indoctrinate the rest of the population and shape the state in communistic ideals and utilising Pavlovian technique, brainwash citizens completely. For those remaining within the populace who still resist and show dissent of any kind, they are shipped off to gulags (concentration work camps) where they either die from malnutrition or over work. The threat Britain is facing is a very real one. In the General Election 2017: 61.5 per cent of under-40s voted for Labour. Many of the young people were only voting for free student loans and other freebies touted by the Corbyn led Labour party, maybe some of these numbers are aware of what communism is, but it is suspected that many do not know, or simply do not care as long as their student loan is written off. With the current weak state of the ruling Conservative party, and the resurgence of communism in Britain today, we must be very careful to keep the peace in the country. All it will take is a few more mistakes by the Tories, or in-fighting that will rouse the extreme left Corbynistas to act, whether violently or not. For true communism however, Corbyn and his Marxist Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, will not hesitate in mobilising and manipulating their brainwashed troops to react, to cause chaos, and to agitate to bring forth total anarchy. Engels’ 1870s work Anti-Dühring describes the process of revolutionary change. The quote begins with “The proletariat seizes state power and turns the means of production into state property to begin with. But thereby it abolishes itself as the proletariat, abolishes all class distinctions and class antagonisms and abolishes the state as state.” Lenin not only supported violent revolution but believed it is “inevitable.” Thus, we see the danger of Labour’s communist ideals under Jeremy Corbyn, who did not win the election in 2017, and is now pushing for change through the Momentum group, through violence, agitation and mass civil disobedience. Lenin said that violent revolution is inevitable and “the necessity of systematically imbuing the masses with this and precisely this view of violent revolution lies at the root of the entire theory of Marx and Engels.” It is not too late to thwart Corbyn and his evil plans. However, we must act now to stop him, before the mass graves fill the horizon of what was once a democratic Britain, and is now a communist prison where many perish without a single thought or note in history.'], ['Theresa May: “So What If I Have Zero Emotional Intelligence”', ' May’s job is to deal with whatever comes up, to coordinate the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that fall in her lap on a daily basis. She is not some weepy, emotional flappy person, or hysteric female, but dedicated to her job. She is detached to the emotion, and this is how she does her job best. Much like other barren women in power at the moment, May like Merkel and Sturgeon are all childless. They did not bow to their natural biological proclivities to have kids, instead preferring to pursue power in politics. Children get in the way for these women, and are deemed beastly burdens for such career obsessed women. We must not begrudge the choices of these career women, as they made their own choices, and thus should be respected for their right to make that choice. Ms May is frankly a misunderstood person, she rides so high to the mountain top, she has no understanding of these little people below. This stance is understandable and completely normal behaviour to those who rule over the plebiscite, they exist in their own world, and only converse with people on or slightly below their level. Dealing with the electorate is every politician’s nightmare, and May knows this only too well. This is why she keeps away from them as much as possible. Unfortunately, this stance showed itself most during the recent election, where May lost the previous Tory majority in the House. Despising the electorate and plebs is nothing to be ashamed of, they are after all the unwashed masses, the uncouth Corbyn followers who believe any lies told to them by their god without question. Naturally, a heavily vetted group of supportive people in a room with May is preferable however fake it looks. As long as May does her job, what should it matter that she despises the common muck?

How about the people who saved up their money, got a deposit on a property and eventually moved in of their accord? How about the people who worked hard, scrimped and saved so their children could be educated in private school? They never asked a single thing from the state. They are educated out of the state, they are treated in hospitals without state help, they live their lives without depending on state handouts and demanding the state does this or that for them. This is why it is sickening to see Kensington town hall being besieged by people demanding this demand, or that demand, when the state does so much for them in the first place. After £10.5 million renovations on the Grenfell Tower in 2013, was that not good enough for the residents? As for the question about cladding, whether it was fire proof or not, that is moot because the insulation under the cladding would catch fire irrespective of fire proof cladding or not. The people wanted renovations and they got them. Their demands were met. The insulation was part of the EU energy saving directive pushed on the UK, so there was no way out of that. According to a Conservative councillor, the residents even refused a sprinkler system when it was offered, as it would be too much of a disruption for residents. What is one to do, you offer this, you offer that, you try and help to no avail. One must see the futility in this exercise. You can come to London from Sub Saharan Africa or anywhere else, and simply demand what you think you are owed from the UK government.

Cladding is often used to improve energy efficiency and it is thought there could be up to 30,000 buildings in the UK fitted with similar cladding to that used on Grenfell Tower to comply with EU energy saving law. Deadly flammable foam boards coated in zinc rainproof sheets were spaced across the 24-storey building as part of the refurbishment. The EU Directive on the energy performance of buildings was adopted in 2002. It was intended to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, reduce carbon emissions and reduce the impact of climate change. On 19 May 2010, the Council of the European Union and European Parliament adopted a recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive in order to strengthen the energy performance requirements of buildings. In addition it clarified and streamlined some of the provisions from the 2002 Directive it replaced. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive are the two main pieces of legislation aimed at reducing the energy consumption of buildings. The principle underlying the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is to make the energy efficiency of buildings transparent by requiring an energy performance certificate showing the energy rating of buildings, accompanied by recommendations on how to improve its efficiency.

Our festival tends to appeal to the middle class camping and picnic enthusiasts who enjoy the ‘background music’ as an afterthought. “Teenagers bring their parents to the event and hold balloons and pirate flags as they dance to acts such as Olly Murs, Mumford And Sons, and Kenny Rogers. Rock n’ roll was never meant to be like this. These festival goers are square.

Do not listen to any authority that tells you to stay in your flat. If the fire service or police tell you to stay in your flat so you can die a painful agonising death, ignore it all costs. At the first sign of smoke or fire, make your way to the nearest exit. If you live on the highest floors, during a fire you will be ignored. The fire service cannot reach that high. This is why you must either invest in a long metal rope ladder or a parachute. Better still invest in abseiling ropes, and do the necessary training. Invest in a gas mask as the tower block will fill up with deadly toxic smoke almost immediately. Gas masks are relatively inexpensive to buy and will save your life. Use your own smoke alarms, do not rely on anything from the authorities that manage the tower block. Do not rely on the stairs or lift of the tower block. Because of cost cutting, these areas should be sprayed with flame retardant materials but are not. Therefore in a fire, they will be most probably on fire. Esentual items for living in a council tower block: Gas masks, torches, fire retardent clothing, parachute, metal ladder, abseiling kit, fire extinguishers, axe, common sense. Never live in a death trap council tower block. This is the best way of saving your life.'], ['Labour Government 1974 Responsible For Death Trap Grenfell Tower Block', 'These grey foreboding tower blocks built across Britain in the 70s are still standing today, they are a blight on the landscape, death traps to the unfortunate, and remnants of socialist engineering that produced misery laden lives of perpetual poverty. If anything is to be done in the future, every single one of these monstrosities should be dynamited and obliterated from the land, they are symbols of socialism gone wrong, of bland concrete greyness that brings upon death to any landscape, of total and utter disdain to humanity. Brutalist architecture To live in one of these concrete blocks is to live a life of extreme hardship, beaten down every day by the stick of socialist poverty-driven benefits, to live and die in such a place is to inhabit a netherworld of constant horror, a place where death is a welcome step over the edge of the precipice. These socialist engineers, the Wilsons, the Callahans, and the Attlees saw themselves as pioneers by sticking thousands of people into little boxes on high rise concrete blocks, but they did not look into the future. From pristine concrete comes dirty black brutal greyness, as the population through mass migration rose, there was white flight, and now we have these tenements simply there to house those deemed as sub-human, the refugee or minority group, along with the drug gangs and assortment of criminals, these tower blocks are now not only ridden with rats and cockroaches, but humans who are too poor to move out. What kind of a land do we live in that creates these prisons, these monstrous hell hole façades of socialist welfare driven concrete death? To burn to death in one of these towers is to liberate the soul from a life of torrid misery, of a living hell where life is not valued but instead celebrated for its poverty, and encouraged by the Labour party. Thank you socialists, you have saved the poor, you are for the many, as the flames lick under your cardboard door, there is no way out now, the heat searing your skin and hair. Jump to freedom or burn, toss a coin as the flames reach out towards you and beckon you into their arms for that final socialist dance.'], ['Champagne Socialist BBC Comedian Honours Corbyn Labour Election Win', '“We won the election.

They are young, dumb and hungry for hope, eager for any morsel from this austerity ridden hell that they swim in. The fact that the country is still under austerity because of the previous Labour government bankrupting Britain is of course not mentioned, to the Corbyn youth, it is a Tory scum problem. Try to explain to any of these fawning Corbynistas that nothing is free, and everything has to be paid for somewhere down the line is useless, because the initial seed has been sown, and no one is going to spoil their socialist utopian fantasy. The fact that the UK still has a debt of £1.8 trillion created by the previous Labour government also falls on deaf ears. They just don’t want to know. Corbyn’s voter base is not just the uninformed young pliable student, but also the ones who are entrenched in the welfare system, unemployed, unemployable, addicts, anarchists, Marxists, millennial snowflakes, these are the disenfranchised angry voters who rarely vote, but Corbyn enticed them to vote this time. To analyse Jeremy Corbyn’s technique in pulling the wool over the eyes of the young, we must study Soviet propaganda techniques as well as the Nazi era use of the youth to put forward their agenda. The Soviet use of repetition was in full swing during the election, where Corbyn continually repeated his promises to the young. By repeating lies and false information you eventually make it a truth amongst those who do not understand politics or economics. The Labour Manifesto was one stacked full of bribes, lies that gave hope to the disenfranchised youth, and false promises that simply were not economically viable. But the clever manipulative Corbyn team did not care that they were peddling half-truths, fake promises, or outright bollocks. If a student sees that the Pied Piper Corbyn is promising that his student loan will be paid off in full by the state, he is going to be out there at first dawn ready to vote Labour. On the other hand, we had the Conservative manifesto, where they stuck to the books, looked at what was affordable, did not promise any ridiculous giveaways, and they paid the price for that one. There was not one single bribe or pledge to give hope to anyone. To be this brutally honest was a major setback and the Conservatives paid the ultimate price by losing their parliamentary majority. Everything is free under socialism The lesson to be learned is, lie as much as you can in the manifesto and create false promises of hope to the youth. They will not question it. Older voters who have experience of political systems, economics or reality will see through it, and this is why you have to target the youth. Young, dumb and full of come. They have little or no understanding of any electoral process, as many have never experienced it before. The youth are ripe for the taking, easily brainwashed and suckered into anything you want them to believe in. Whoever wants to win the next election will have to thus follow the Corbyn technique of selling false hope to the youth. To get the grey vote, sell them some cleverly filtered lies and false promises as well and you’re well sorted.'], ['Post-Election Latest: Therexit Put on Hold For Brexit', 'Brexit approved by H.R.H Suddenly, out of the blue, prominent Brexiteer Michael Gove has come back from the wilderness to offer the beleaguered PM some advice on how to Brexit. Even Boris Johnson is firmly behind the PM, as he wants the Brexit negotiations to go on unhindered. “I am asking everyone to hold off until things are safe once again, then I’ll make my move,” the Boris said from Whatsapp. Ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer, the vengeful George Osborne, has been caught gloating about the current mess the Tories and PM are now in. Please stop it George, it looks very vulgar and cheap. You really are a sad bastard aren’t you? Meanwhile on the other side of the political spectrum, deluded Jeremy Corbyn is claiming he won the election even though his party were 53 odd seats shy of a majority. In true communistic style, he refuses to believe the obvious and is continuing to soldier on in his own frazzled Soviet mind. An alliance with the DUP, an Irish gang of political conservative thugs who make the Tories look like a bunch of girl scouts, is sure to make things even more unpleasant for the snowflake generation of Corbyn voters.

So, why does a large part of Britain hate themselves and their Britishness? This comes down to socialist indoctrination, political correctness, and a devout hatred of Britain, at such a level that these people who voted for Labour would collaborate with the enemy, and the truth is they have helped Britain’s enemies profoundly by voting Labour. It seems there is an ingrained level of self-hatred, dumbed down masochistic fervour that much of the British electorate wish upon themselves time after time by voting Labour, and the June 8 election was one of these moments. By voting Labour, you have committed unconscionable harm on Britain, and aided our enemies, you have in fact created a situation now that will hurt British interests abroad and within for many years to come.

It is evident that Britain is full of low information c*nts who would vote for a terrorist sympathiser simply because he paraded numerous election bribes in front of their faces.

However, open your eyes and you’ll see that superstitions lurk all around us, with luck icons pervading many areas of daily life. As such, let’s zone in on five luck icons that are hiding in plain sight all around us. Troll dolls From toddlers to white van drivers, troll dolls have proven unnervingly popular with consumers in the UK. Created by Danish woodcutter Thomas Dam in 1959, troll dolls were originally made of wood and sold as ‘good luck trolls.’ Troll doll buying crazes took place in the 1960s, 70s and 90s, before being reignited once more when Dreamworks released its Trolls movie in 2016. Most troll doll owners are unfamiliar with how rooted in superstition their ugly little toys are, but the figurines actually stem straight from Scandinavian folklore. Scandinavian superstition holds that a person who is laughing can’t have anything bad happen to them. Thomas Dam decided to make his trolls’ features so hideous that they would make their owners chuckle. He comments, “They were so ugly that you couldn’t help but laugh, and when you laugh, luck follows you.” Buddha statues From spas and gardens to restaurants and bars, Buddha statues pop up in all sorts of places. Most of us in the West simply see them as decorative objects, but Buddha statues bring with them a whole host of superstitions. Meditating Buddha statues are associated with peace and harmony. Meanwhile, laughing Buddha statues are reported to bring good luck and wealth to those who own them (hence their popularity with restaurant and bar owners). Rubbing a laughing Buddha’s substantial belly is also said to be lucky. Fortune cats Fortune cats are an Eastern tradition that has been firmly adopten by Western culture. Called Maneki Neko, fortune cats are those decorative little cat statues with the waving paw that you see in Asian restaurants, supermarkets and shops. Tradition holds that the cats bring good luck and fortune, but it’s not just Asian business owners who conform to the superstition. Have you looked around your local bingo hall recently? Whether online or offline, bingo sites have subscribed firmly to the trend of fortune cats, taking inspiration from Eastern tradition and giving it a contemporary, Western twist. Don’t forget to wave back! Credit: Pixabay Horseshoes A great favourite with pubs looking to style themselves at once as traditional country ale houses and contemporary urban gastro eateries, horseshoes adorn the walls of pubs the length and breadth of the UK. However, it’s not just our boozers that have adopted the horseshoe as a good luck symbol – it’s also commonly used as part of wedding decorations. From necklaces and cufflinks to table decorations, horseshoes frequently crop up as good luck symbols to bless unions. The horseshoe as a symbol of good luck dates back to 959 AD, when the Devil visited St Dunstan (then a blacksmith, in his pre-sainthood days) and asked him for a horseshoe (clearly the devil’s hooves aren’t immune to wear and tear just because he’s the devil). Quick-thinking St Dunstan promptly nailed a red-hot horseshoe to the Devil who, despite a reputation for enjoying infernos, found the occurrence to be rather painful and begged for the horseshoe’s removal. St Dunstan complied, but only after making the Devil promise to never enter a place which had a horseshoe hung above the door. Credit: Pixabay Four-leaved clovers The four-leaved clover occurs naturally but rarely, with only around 1 in 10,000 white clovers having four leaves (rather than the usual three). From bingo halls to jewellery, four leaf clovers abound in the West, with the symbol having become one of the most pervasive lucky charms. Legend has it that Eve sneaked a four leaf clover out of Paradise when she was kicked out and thus anyone who owns one has their own little piece of Paradise. By the Middle Ages, the belief had arisen that those with a four-leaved clover were able to see fairies, as well as to recognise witches and other evil spirits. It thus acted as protection against such creatures. Today, the four-leaved clover has become like so many other Western luck icons – their roots are frequently forgotten, but the symbols themselves survive, hiding their superstitious heritage in plain sight.'], ['Jeremy Corbyn Serious Threat to National Security Monitored By Special Branch', 'W hat many of his followers do not know is that Jeremy Corbyn is deemed a threat to national security by Special Branch and the MI5, because of his links to terrorist groups as well as his ideological beliefs which include Marxism, communism and his plans to use totalitarian authoritarian ruling techniques that would thwart democracy. Communism is a political ideology which was responsible for more than 120 million deaths in the 20th Century. As an authoritarian ideology it is one of the most inhibitive forms of rule, and if Corbyn and his Momentum group come into power, not only will our democratic values suffer but many of our treasured institutions like parliament and the royal family will be damaged forever. As a staunch republican, Corbyn is planning to do away with Britain’s long standing royal family. He also wants to nationalise every part of business, including the banking industry. He wants to undo Brexit and gain ever closer union with the EU, as well as dump the British pound for the euro. Under Corbyn, Britain will become a de facto Soviet state where all speech will be heavily monitored and censored. There will be another massive increase in surveillance and monitoring of private citizens will be seen as the norm. We have already witnessed how hard it is to kick Corbyn out of the Labour party, well, as PM, it will be nigh on impossible to kick Corbyn out as under communism, the elections held will be heavily controlled one party affairs. All other political parties will thus be outlawed under a Corbyn communist regime, and those who disagree with him will be imprisoned. This hard line method is exactly what Corbyn plans to unveil a few years into his rule. The Orwellian nightmare brought upon the UK will be so awful that many will try to flee these shores, and many will be caught and put into re-education programs. With Britain’s wealth tied up mainly in property, punitive taxation schemes will whittle down private wealth and move it to the state. Eventually, the plan is to abolish all ownership of private property, apart from those deemed worthy, i.e. high party Labour officials who will get preferential treatment. Labour during the election campaign has been targeting Britain’s youth, who do not know anything about communism, let alone politics. By targeting the youth with false bribes relating to free education and free benefits, free housing, free travel, free beer, Labour is making promises it cannot keep but will ensure a young vote, simply because the youth only see the word ‘free’ in front of everything. This ploy suckers in many naive young people who do not bother to question and are ill informed about economics and politics. June 8th is thus the day that the country will either be saved or lost. If Labour wins, you must start thinking of leaving Britain and taking your hard earned wealth before it gets really bad, if the Conservatives win, then Britain and Brexit will be saved.'], ['Facts and Figures of the Online Gaming Market', 'W hether it be fighting against your friend on the latest console game, or playing a game on your mobile device, the ability to play online has changed the playing field in a huge way. To see the impact of the Internet on gaming, you just have to look at the figures. Taking Grand Theft Auto V as an example, this is a game that has been out for years, but is still huge. Grossing around $1 billion worldwide in just 3 days it is a truly huge game. The online side of the game is further extending its life, with only Red Dead Redemption 2 coming out in 2018 a real competitor to its popularity. Another aspect of online gaming is the move to digital sales for the games. In 2016 digital and online games grossed £1.22bn in the UK where boxed games brought in £766.7m. Mobile gaming also brought in £955.1m. The fact that both mobile gaming and digital sales out grossed boxed games shows that our gaming habits are definitely moving online, in both sales and playing the games. Moving away from sales and looking to how much profit online gaming brings in on a global scale, the amounts are staggering. With a total of 99.6bn in 2016 it is no surprise that the games industry is noticing where the real money is made. This big rise of course is brought in by the rise of mobile gaming and the freemium model that most games use now. Through the use of in-game purchases and the players willing to add money to their games, games companies are now making huge profits in these games. We can’t complain too much about this though, the more profit made this way, the more money can be invested in the big Triple A games on the major consoles. Gaming on mobile gaming comes in many forms, from the very lucrative Candy Crush Saga clones, to live casino in the UK, and of course the huge Pokémon Go game, players have never had so much choice. It will be interesting to see if the popularity of Pokémon Go brings in a new wave of augmented reality games, and what impact virtual reality will have. Online gaming is incredibly lucrative to game companies, and most importantly is very popular to gamers. While it is always a mistake to forget the importance of solo player options, the future is definitely in social gaming.

Until the UK leaves the EU and dumps EU law, it cannot do anything to deport or jail terrorists who pose a threat to the public. In pretty much every case, the European Court of Human Rights thwarted any attempt to deal with terrorists citing “Rule 39” as the reason. It’s not only known terrorists on the watch list who are untouchable, but foreign killers, criminals and rapists are also protected fully by the ECHR. According to MI5, there are over 3,400 terrorists in Britain on the watch list, and an estimated 23,000 extreme Islam fanatics on the loose all over the country. These people are free to go wherever they want and to plot any new attacks as they wish. They are all protected by EU laws and are rarely arrested even though their intentions may be known.

Under the Obama regime, nothing changed for African Americans, in fact, they took ten steps back into even more racial disharmony and near civil war. An opportunity failed to uplift African Americans by the first ever African president of the United States will always haunt the Obama legacy. Is there an answer to this inherent disparity? If African Americans read more books, educated themselves on a par with others, there could be some form of competition, but until that time, nothing new will happen and blacks will forever be stuck at the bottom of the scrap heap. Obama promised ‘Change’, but none came. Change must instead come from within the black community, otherwise it will never materialise, people have to want to read books, people have to want to educate their children.

Nowadays, every casino game you have encountered is available in a digitalized format on online casino sites. Players are able to access, play and win big by simply sitting in front of their computer screens. However, in order to profit from this hobby in the long run, there are certain aspects of online casino sites that you need to be familiar with. Games Selection Nearly all casino sites allow you to play online casino games from the four general categories: slots, table games, video poker and specialty games. Some may choose to group them differently, but they still manage to cover all types in order to provide you with your preferred option. Online Casino Software Online casinos may offer you an instant-play version of their software or a downloadable program that you need to install. Before making your choice, you should make sure that this software is compatible with your computer operating system. Due to their initial success, online casinos nowadays tend to include a mobile version of their software which fits the most popular mobile systems Android and iOS. Bonus Offers & Promotions A good indicator of the reliability of a casino site is their bonus and promotions section. The best online casinos include the standard No Deposit and First Deposit bonuses, as well as VIP promotional programs. These offers basically provide you with ‘free money’ which you can use to test the casino software before depositing your own. Wagering Requirements In order to use your bonuses and promotions optimally, you should know that they come with certain conditions known as wagering requirements. They signify the amount of money you need to deposit after using up your bonus cash in order to withdraw any winnings. This amount is normally several times bigger than the bonus you received. For example, if you claimed a $20 No Deposit Bonus with 30x wagering requirement, you would need to deposit and play through 20×30=$600. Legal Responsibilities The legal regulations which apply to online casinos are connected with the gambling laws of each player’s country of residence. This includes the minimum legal age at which you can play online casino games, most often ranging from 18 to 21 years. Players are also encouraged to practice legal gambling at online casino sites and to take responsibility for their actions.

According to reports six or seven people were either stabbed or shot by a terrorist. A white van was seen ploughing through groups of pedestrians on the pavement. Significant rapid gunfire reports have been heard, and the scene is one of total chaos. This attack is significant as it is so close to an election on June 8, between the Conservatives who are strong on anti-terror measures and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party who support terrorist groups like the IRA, Hamas and Hezbollah.

Evil comes with a gentle false smiling face The tone of gentleness, here is a man who supposedly cares for you, who will ensure you get your benefits payments increased without question, who will allow the entirety of Sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and the Middle East into Britain without question. This is a man who smiles at the camera, while the horrors of his evil terrorist supporting mind fester in the background. He cares about animals and does not want to see them in pain, just as he did when the IRA he supports so much slaughtered six horses with nail bombs in 1982. Unflinching in his dedication to surrender, here is a man who would leave Britain defenceless, and open to attack. Naturally Corbyn and his senior minions would be in the government bunker whilst up top millions of Britons die from radiation poisoning or the after effects of a nuclear strike. He would sit there with his cup of tea, and think about maybe writing a postcard or letter to our attackers telling them to stop. This stance of ineptitude and apathy in the face of defence is in fact the face of evil that Corbyn adopts as it gives him more power to do so. Here is a man who will gladly flood the country with millions of more migrants so that the already stretched services will cease to function. His magic money tree, an illusion only conceived by false election promises to a dumbed down electorate who are too naive to see the reality. Real evil lies in irresponsibility and meticulous planning The inherent evil of such a man as Corbyn is hard to see but it is there, because he clouds it in the false promise of care, and hope. In reality the Labour manifesto promises are just that, promises that cannot in any way be fulfilled under the current economic climate. As for UKIPers who follow the pied piper to Labour, you will see Brexit watered down to a mere shell, it will be Brexit in mere name only, and when Corbyn adopts the euro as Britain’s currency, integrating Britain into the EU in ever closer union, you will see how you were duped and fooled once more by the evil smiling bearded chap who was oh so soft spoken, surely he could not have done this, no, you will say as you cry into your pillow at night. It is guaranteed Corbyn will also integrate with the SNP, thus losing any fighting chance the English have in stopping a break away referendum from happening and succeeding. As the Britain we once knew turns into another socialist utopia akin to Venezuela, there will be no hope, just massive inflation, riots, huge queues for toilet paper and all services within the country will break down, irreparable, ghosts of the past, and monuments to the future under Labour. Everything’s free of course under Labour’s Corbyn, but at what cost? We already have a deficit of £1.8 Trillion thanks to the previous Labour government, and so it will go on, Corbyn will add to this deficit until it reaches ten or twenty trillion pounds, why should he care, it will give him power, and this evil power has corrupted his soul into blackness. It is with this dark festering soul he will condemn Britain to a two hundred year generational debt nightmare, full of poverty, and civil unrest. At the end of the day, Corbyn is just a career politician, a seasoned liar who is promising all these things to the easily pliable naive youth with limited experience of how government really works. Labour is targeting the youth simply because they are an easy target, as much as army recruiters do, they can be convinced easily with lies and half-truths, false promises interspersed with bribes. Pawns in a game of death as cannon fodder for the muddied battle field. If you are a Corbyn supporter reading this, you are an ineffectual human being not worth much. You have no reasoning or logical powers, you are uneducated and follow false promises without question. To say you are a dumb animal would be an insult to animals, you are lower than that. Corbyn supporters are useless eaters, the Untermenschen of society who are deprived of a normal thought process, you are lemmings, you are slaves to a socialist system of welfare that wants to keep you dumbed down, a mere enslaved piece of detritus now given an order to vote, and you will follow your orders well, because in your brainwashed, socialist conditioned brain cell, there is no part of you that can be defined as a normal functioning human with a mind of your own. It is off to the slaughter house for you, and you will toddle off with a deranged face as your leader gently cajoles you onward. For those who wake up from the conditioned rhetoric and brainwashing tones of Corbyn, well done, for the others, there is no hope for you. Willingly you will go to the showers and when the gas comes through the pipes, you will see the smiling face of Corbyn looking through the plexiglass portal. Your job is done, he will have no more need for you.'], ['Virtual Reality for Online Casinos', 'Virtual reality refers to a simulation or computer-created world that you can enter by putting on a virtual reality helmet. These helmets (or headsets) are made specially with multiple LED screens and an installed sound system, and are impenetrable to sound or light thus guaranteeing a one of a kind experience for the user. When it comes to the use of new technologies in online casinos, we’ve certainly come a long way from the online casinos of 20 years ago with minimal graphics and a highly artificial setting. Advances in technology has given way to incredibly sharp images and high quality games, where the player really feels like a part of the action. One of the downsides to online gambling is the lack of the social aspect prevalent in brick-and-mortar casinos. Gambling from home is convenient but it lacks the excitement and thrill that comes from placing bets surrounded by real people. That’s where virtual reality comes in. Now try and imagine walking around your house and it being as if you were walking through a casino. Once the helmet is on, the player interacts with the screen using a hand-held controller. There is free range to explore the casino and all of its slots, table games and poker rooms. As live dealer online casinos are already a thing, where instead of a computer dealing out the cards there is a real live person that appears on your screen, we can only imagine what it will be like when players can interact with other players inside the casino with their virtual reality headset. Try looking for the best online casino and they are undoubtedly looking to innovate and keep up with the competition at all times. The online gaming industry is undergoing constant change and augmented reality is a glimpse at what the future may hold for this industry on the rise. Nevertheless, there are many obstacles to overcome before this can become a part of the mainstream online gambling world. While it is going to be a challenge, there are many companies who are already on their way to making their vision of a VR casino a reality, and many believe that the concept of VR gambling could become the face and future of online gaming.'], ['Labour Using Brainwashing Techniques on Britain’s Pliable Young', "Britain's pliable naive youth have been brainwashed by Labour's overt use of soviet mind control techniques T he evil mind control techniques capitalise on the naive, low information young voters who do not understand politics or the machinations of the world yet. “By targeting the youth, you are targeting a group of people who are very susceptible to believing in lies, just as long as these lies are peppered with seemingly true false promises and bribes. For example, Labour is saying that all tuition should be free, and this will help a generation of kids, however they are also not telling the kids that Britain has a deficit of £1.8 Trillion and that by adding onto the debt mountain, these kids will be paying treble for the burden in the future, as will their kids, their grandchildren, and many generations ahead,” an observer revealed. Labour, is not only utilising soviet techniques of repetition to drum through their lies to the easily susceptible youth but further techniques in play include: coercion, bribery, blatant lies interspersed with bits of factual truth, ad hominem attacks on the opponent, as well as social alienation if you do not tow the party line. An Oxford team of researchers has already caught out Labour using bots on Twitter to continually discredit Theresa May and the Conservatives. The millions of fake bots are set up to continually spew out hatred and derision at anything that is Tory. This coupled with a youth who are easily swayed, never ask questions and are always up for free things is a recipe for disaster when it comes to an election."], ['Labour Election: Corbyn Plotting Destruction of Royal Family', ' Insiders for Momentum and anti-royalist groups like Republic are encouraged by Jeremy Corbyn’s rise in the polls, but are not giving anything away in public. The plan will be to take away the Sovereign Grant which officially equates to approximately £45 million per annum. The Sovereign Grant is financed chiefly by taxpayers through the Treasury and from a percentage of the profits of the Crown Estate revenue, currently at 15%. Corbyn’s reasoning for closing the Sovereign Fund will be that the Queen and the rest of the royal family receive enough monies from the Crown Estate, therefore there is no need for such a heavy burden on the Treasury where that money could be used for social welfare. The Queen can get by without the Sovereign Fund, however if she is forced to pay incoming taxation to the vast land owned by the Windsors, things will go awry. From this point, the Crown Estate will also be subject to vast punitive taxation, and the Queen’s land holdings which equate to 46,000 acres of land will be subject to crushing land value taxes. Eventually, the Crown estate will be whittled down to a mere shadow of its former self, leaving the royals floundering in their palaces, which will eventually be nationalised as places where the public can visit and picnic in. Do not be fooled by Corbyn’s niceties during the electioneering, his intention is solely to de-fund, then eventually unseat the British royal families, who he has previously called ‘parasites’ and ‘scavengers’. Jeremy Corbyn did not kneel in front of the Queen as is protocol for good reason, he fucking hates her guts, and he hates the royal family with a vengeance as a lifelong Republican. It is sad to say that thousands of years of pageantry and British history could finally come to a sorry end if Labour comes into power, but like a good Bolshevik, Comrade Corbyn is on a mission, and he will not stop until it is completed, in full.'], ['The Rise of Mobile Gaming', ' It is estimated that the global mobile sales revenue for 2016 exceeded the $40billion mark, bigger than both the global tea and global navel market if we are to put it into perspective. Perhaps it’s fair to say that now, mobiles dominate our lives. The time that Americans spend on their mobile, with non-voice content is set to increase to 203 minutes by 2018, up 50% from the 135 minutes recorded in 2013. In addition to this, mobile internet usage is expected to rise from 140 minutes per day, to 189 minutes per day, a growth of 35%. Of that time, mobile web usage is expected to account for just 16.7%, roughly eight minutes or say. The remaining mobile internet time will be spent in-app on the likes of games and social media. Mobile games contribute very highly to the growing rate of mobile use, globally, the mobile gaming industry generated more than $30billion in 2015, of course rising 33% to $40billion the following year. Unsurprisingly, that figure is set to grow again in 2017. Revenues from games downloaded from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store accounted for between 90 and 80% of the respective store’s total revenue. In 2016, it was revealed that the average gamer plays an average of 3.6 mobile games per month and 1.3 games on a daily basis. In 2015, over 51% of smartphone users were using their mobile devices to play games, with that figure expected to exceed 60% by 2018 whilst it continues to grow. Arcade and action games may have led in popularity when it comes to the genres of mobile games, with said types being downloaded more than 60 million times in mid-2016, though they’re not the only games receiving rave reviews. Many people are now using their mobile devices to play mobile bingo. Britain’s favourite pastime once looked archaic with bingo halls up and down the country shutting to lack of demand but thanks to the online gaming industry, the game is back with a bang. There a plethora of fantastic bingo sites out there offering the perfect opportunity for gamers to try their hand at generating a house and winning some cash, a kitty that is much boosted by many of the sites’ great bonuses and promotion offers. The sheer convenience of mobile gaming makes online bingo the perfect solution for those wanting to try their hand at gambling or fans who can’t make it to the bingo hall. Thanks to the advent of the smartphone, players no longer need to arrange plans or leave the house to have a night playing bingo but can do so from the comfort of their own home. And of course, player’s can even play on the go, whether they’re on the bus to work, at a friend’s house, at a café, morning, noon or night.'], ['Labour: “Britain’s Population Through Immigration to Rise by 60%”', ' For an island which only makes up 93,000 square miles, in contrast, the USA has eleven states larger than the UK, we are a tiny already overcrowded land mass. Our current population as of 2015 was 65.14 million, and already the roads and transport systems are at buckling point. Housing is severely in shortage, hospitals have patients stuffed in corridors and broom cupboards, and schools have 50-60 children per class. 104,000,000 people packed into 93,000 square miles is of course acceptable to Labour, because they obviously have no standards of living, and their chief concern will be importing future Labour voters so they stay in perpetual power for the next fifty years. Imagine the massive onslaught that will be wrought on Britain with another Labour open door policy, where literally 40 million people will be welcomed into the straining pit of Britain, to make a living hell, an even more unimaginable nightmare of existence. It would be silly not to mention the massive increase in breeding by migrant populations will completely change the whole landscape of the country not only culturally but economically where poverty, shanty towns, and crime will reign. It is estimated by 2035, Britain will thus have a population of over 112 million factoring migrant breeding. There will be no NHS as funding for a free service will have been dropped many years back, schools will all have class sizes of a minimum of 180 pupils, there will be severe civil unrest as only a few people will have jobs, there will be little or no money for welfare payments, and the country will buckle under massively overcrowded transport systems. Those who live in a house will be few and far between as the massive tower blocks housing hundreds of thousands of citizens in tiny rooms will be the norm. The Malthusian nightmare is welcomed by Labour, they do not care for you or the ecosphere, as they cram and cram millions of people on top of each other like rats. Sadly, the misinformed idiots who are fooled into voting Labour have no idea about its policies or the consequences of what will happen under their irresponsible communist regime. If they do have an idea of what is going to happen under Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour, they are obviously masochists and sadists who welcome self-punishment with a deranged smiling face.

And so, we are now at an impasse, where the anti-Brexit, Marxist, Socialist, anti-private property, high tax loving, anti-business, pro-EU contingent have hijacked the high ground. It seems the awkward timid Theresa May has seriously underestimated the seething self-hatred that underlines Modern Britain today when it comes to the socialist class and their Momentum movement of communistic fervour. To try and explain that the socialists plans are not economically viable is redundant, as they do not hear sense, logic or factual data. In their communist brainwashing they are completely in allegiance to the soviet EU state which is run completely by unelected eurocrats. The BBC bias is to be understood, as they receive large payments from the EU. The anti-Brexit activist Gina Miller from Guyana, is financed by George Soros, and the EU. The Labour party anti-Brexit operatives like Mandelson and Blair have a hotline direct to Brussels as they engineer more plots with Lib Dem vile traitors like Nick Clegg and Tim Farron. Casting a shadow over Britain today is a PM fighting for her life, in a very subdued way. She does not seem to exude much passion or energy seeing as the polls are now showing a major movement towards the Marxist Labour party led by Jeremy Corbyn. False promises Instead of leading with a passionate Brexit strategy during campaigning, May instead talked about dementia, or other social issues which are low on scale of things to be done. She should have rallied the troops instead of turning left, and this is why she is now in a pit, having taken a gamble that may unseat the Tories. It is evident that socialists do not care how much debt they put Britain in to fund their vast welfare spending drive. The only alarm bells that will ring is when all the money runs out, as happened in the last Labour government. From a 22 point lead to minus 5 We may get a hung parliament, we may get a Labour majority in parliament, and from this mess, we may get a lesson in humility, that the silent majority in this country now who rear their heads only on election day are the millions of migrants let in by Blair, the millions of unemployable staunch communists, and the millions of disaffected brainwashed youth who march to the red sock sandalled step of Jeremy Corbyn. June the 8th, will thus be an important election, because it may mean the loss of Brexit, the loss of private property in the UK, the loss of the royal family, the loss of business, the loss of entrepreneurial spirit, and ultimately the loss of Britain as a viable free nation.

It’s not only the rich with their vast gardens that will be hit hard, but the middle classes, pensioners and those trying to get on the property ladder. Even if you have a mid terraced property with a tiny garden, depending on the area you live in you will be paying over £4,500 per annum. In Westminster local tax would rise a massive 2,300 per cent to £17,413 at the highest end. In Kensington and Chelsea, where the average home is worth £1.4m, town hall taxes would jump from £1,208 to £23,213, an increase of £22,005, or 1,821 per cent. One of the poorest council areas of England – Barking and Dagenham – would see hard pressed council tax payers faced with an average bill of more than 500 per cent more at £4,579 a year. Jeremy Corbyn, a staunch communist Marxist has included the Land Value Tax in the Labour manifesto, and will implement the deadly tax on households as early as September this year, once in power, leaving little or no time to sell up before the tax is implemented. Not only will the Land Value Tax affect the most vulnerable in society and pensioners, but the tax will be exercised on farm land, thus increasing the price of food enormously. Vegetables, bread, egg and milk prices will rise by an estimated 250% within the first year of the Labour tax and continue to rise year on year. Naturally with such large costs incurred on homeowners, many will not be able to pay and repossessions will increase. Accompanied with the high rise of food costs in the UK, many will fall into poverty, which is what Jeremy Corbyn and his evil communist apparatchiks want. So, what can you do?

Essentially under the Corbyn Sovietized regime, Britain would become a communist state where a network of voluntary associations and workers’ councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” would rule. The Royal family would be abolished within the second or third year of the Corbyn Ten Year Plan. The process of de-funding the royal purse will commence slowly and almost unseen to the public, until legislation will be passed to completely de-fund the royal family in its entirety. All royal palaces and property will become property of the state, and deemed for the people. Faced with tax bills of over 90% for the wealthy, many will leave these shores and take their wealth elsewhere. The time to start planning for this is now as the Labour party is already 5 points within the Conservatives according to recent polls. The brain drain will leave Britain without doctors, surgeons, scientists, and all other professional class, as well as entrepreneurial business. The assumption that Labour will raise funds by taxing the rich within an inch of their lives is absolutely ridiculous, as many will go offshore to preserve their wealth. How is Corbyn going to fund his ‘free everything for everyone’ society when the majority of wealth moves out of the UK? All foreign investment into the UK will also cease as many are deterred by the inhibitive taxation system of the Labour government. The mass exodus, and brain drain out of Britain will leave only the poor and struggling middle classes who will then be pulled into welfare poverty by the ever increasing tax demands of the welfare state. Queuing for a Soviet piece of bread Labour’s ridiculous plans for tax hikes aimed at top earners and businesses will “not raise anything like” the £48.6 billion claimed and their proposals could turn out to be “economically damaging”, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned.

Patton The terrorist who exploded a nail bomb at a concert packed with little girls last night was well known to the police and MI5, as was the individual who attacked parliament last month. Therefore, in the interests of public safety, it is not good enough to monitor known threats to the public, but to detain these individuals indefinitely. Unfortunately, because of the EU open border Schengen system, many returning Jihadis from the war zones of Syria have returned to their Western European places of abode, and they have been told to inflict damage on the population by their ISIS commanders and media. This can be circumnavigated by adopting proper procedures at points of entry, where these known Jihadis are detained indefinitely on arrival. The UK, and USA must lead in the fight, and the only way to stop the violence is unfortunately through total violence against those who wish harm on the West purely based on an ideology that is skewed and immovable. By mobilising troops, and the totality of naval plus air forces onto Syria, the cleansing of the area could be completed within months with the correct troop numbers. There may have to be a draft in the UK, and USA, which would bolster the current troop numbers including reserves. The key point to note is that the regime of Assad would end, and ISIS as well as the numerous other factions would be removed indefinitely. It is interesting to see Donald Trump visiting the Wahabi state of Saudi Arabia and bowing to the royal family, when much of the ideology, monetary support and belief system for ISIS comes from that country. It is yet unclear which member states are the key funders of ISIS also giving them weapon support, and intelligence. One must first look at who benefits from this terror group, cui bono? On the ground, ISIS are murdering more Muslims than any other group, of these mainly Shias bear the brunt. The Shias in Syria are supported by Iran and Russia, and the Sunnis by mainly the Gulf states and possibly Israeli clandestine operations, but that is pure speculation. The key to Syria is Iran, and the power play here also extends to Turkey, which as a crucial point in the geo-political territorial game is a very powerful player. This is where the quandary lies, by defeating ISIS completely, the West plays into the hands of Iran and Russia, who will extend their territorial advantage over Syria and Iraq. To not defeat ISIS and carry on arming them as the previous U.S. president was doing, only buys time in an increasingly volatile situation. Therefore, the only real course of action is to defeat not only the Iranian backed insurgents, to annihilate Assad, and to destroy ISIS completely, whilst hoping that Russia/Iran backs away, which is highly unlikely. If everything is put on the ground right now, including a population of drafted military personnel from the ages of 18-35, the problem could be solved relatively quickly. It is now up to the leaders of Western nations to either kick the can further down the road, and continue to be bombarded by terrorists, and their cities drowned by fleeing refugees from war zones, or to end the conflict once and for all. The play is up to you, and only you can make the key decisions, but until that time, the terrorist atrocities and attacks will continue on a weekly, monthly basis. No musical venue, no public place or sports stadium will be safe. The advantages of mobilising a vast ground war is that the defence industry and economy will also find a massive boost. The military draft is the only answer to this problem and must be administered immediately.

That is the only way the Don is going to survive a presidency. Don’t speak to any press that is under the leftwing bias, don’t fucking tweet any more.

By tweeting your every brain fart, you not only give away your every intention to your enemies but you add fuel to the fire and obstruct the workings of your team.

Juncker’s father-in-law, Louis Mathias Frising — dad to Juncker’s wife of 35 years Christiane — was a teacher in Ettelbruck, Luxembourg, when the Germans invaded in 1940. Frising volunteered to be a Nazi propaganda chief while banning spoken French in favour of German. He was also responsible for enforcing the Nuremberg Laws which stripped Jews of their rights and professions — the first stage of the Holocaust. Juncker’s five year term as unelected president of the EU Commission will net him £1.8 million, a tidy sum with all the many perks of the job, a gold plated pension plan and housing allowance. “It’s a nice job if you can get it. You answer to no one, drink as much booze as you want, and get to pick the prettiest young escorts you want, plus you get paid for it,” an EU insider revealed. When he is rarely not drunk, Juncker has moments of clarity, but these moments are very rare. He is said to enjoy a few glasses of the best cognac for breakfast, and much more throughout the day. When it comes to Brexit, Juncker is a gifted liar, and has no qualms in stitching Britain up, he hates the English with a profound vehemence, and will do anything to ruin the country. This man is dangerous, vindictive, untrustworthy and inherently nasty with little or no conscience, and these attributes to his vile psychopathic character give fuel to Brexit, so we must be thankful for their abundance. Quoting Juncker also reveals much of his character: ______________________________ On Greece’s economic meltdown in 2011 “When it becomes serious, you have to lie.” On EU monetary policy “I’m ready to be insulted as being insufficiently democratic, but I want to be serious … I am for secret, dark debates” On British calls for a referendum over Lisbon Treaty “Of course there will be transfers of sovereignty. But would I be intelligent to draw the attention of public opinion to this fact?,” On French referendum over EU constitution “If it’s a Yes, we will say ‘on we go’, and if it’s a No we will say ‘we continue’,” On the introduction of the euro “We decide on something, leave it lying around, and wait and see what happens. If no one kicks up a fuss, because most people don’t understand what has been decided, we continue step by step until there is no turning back.” On eurozone economic policy and democracy “We all know what to do, we just don’t know how to get re-elected after we’ve done it” ______________________________ All we can say is thank you Herr Juncker, please do carry on with what you are doing, as you are doing a great job in turning people off the EU, and are instrumental in its own destruction from within.'], ['Guy Ritchie Del Boy King Arthur Falls On Its Sword', 'According to reports from Hollywood, this film stands to lose $150 million at the box office. Imagine a bunch of wide boys in medieval England a la Lock, Stock and Barrel, maybe plonk in a footballer somewhere or a few other cockney bastards, then give them GQ photoshoot renderings of medieval clothes, Eastender haircuts and a horse to run up and down hills shouting incoherent gibberish, all the while edited with the same old Guy Ritchie camera movement clichés. Guy Ritchie always uses the same old techniques to film his movies, utilising high-speed photography to slow things down at critical moments, as well as wipes here and everywhere, you don’t know where to look as the camera zips around at break neck speed. Stick a go-pro on the shoulders of a group of people running, speed it up, slow it down, all for a measly $175 million. Super quick cuts is the norm in a Guy Ritchie film, afterwards, if you don’t have a searing fucking headache, you haven’t been watching. There are no long meandering shots, or John Huston-esque panoramic landscapes, no, not in a Ritchie film, where the only qualification one needs to watch one is to either be on methamphetamine or suffer from severe attention deficit disorder. Ritchie also likes to stick in narrators in practically every scene, usually some cockney gangster type who starts spouting rhyming slang all over the fucking place, something the Americans watching probably will never get. Everyone’s got a quip or a quick fire answer in a Ritchie film, thus making the whole movie’s dialogue into something resembling a pub quiz in Bethnal Green on a Thursday night. The gratuitous insertions of token blacks would never be seen in medieval England, but it’s necessary in today’s politically correct Hollywoodized pathetic mediocre pap landscape, and Ritchie has obviously bowed to the pressure. If you can get through that minefield of cinematic cliché, wait until you try and follow the plot, or multiple useless plots usually put in a top hat, mixed around and spewed onto the screen as an incomprehensible mish mash of incoherent fast scenes, speeded up film, flashbacks, and ridiculous characters talking the same old tired shit they did in the last Guy Ritchie film sporting the same old tired haircuts. Add in the pathetic cast, including celebrity underwear model David Beckham and you have a recipe so dire that even people with little or no standards will start to question themselves in paying to see this crap. If you’re going to see it, simply key in the film’s title alongside the words ‘123 movies’ or ‘putlocker’ and you can watch for free. Do not under any circumstances think of giving these idiots any money for this farce.

The UK is already £1.2 Trillion in debt thanks to the previous Labour government, and yet in this new manifesto, it seems that not one lesson was ever learned by the grotesque useless spending of the past years. You can’t just give people free stuff, someone has to pay for this shit, but the high earners are the Labour target, so if you tax them to death, what incentive is there for aspiration, innovation or growth — none. Corbyn would ideally like to nationalise all private property, and that’s including your home which you have worked and scraped for years to acquire. He also wants to bring the trade unions into Number 10, which would be a disaster for all business and enterprise in the UK. As for migration, it’s a big fucking open door for Corbyn’s Marxist Momentum movement. People in Britain are already heaped up on top of each other like rats, you can’t drive on the traffic filled narrow British roads any more, and here is this guy inviting the rest of Sub Saharan Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia into the tiny Isle of Britain. There’s not enough square feet of land for that, what are you going to do, have people hanging from trees and digging underground? The ludicrous Labour manifesto is so over the top that even a Venezuelan tin pot socialist dictator would baulk at it, and yet the lemmings who do not question, who do not look at other sources, or basically cannot count accept this shit without even a drop of logical, perceptive thought. How insane that socialists can be this fucking dumb, that they are some sort of robotic ‘yes’ monkey, with no ability to see through the lies and bullshit. A post-Corbyn government according to the Marxist socialists will have everyone as equal, which in human term is impossible, but they just do not get it. How can you have a rocket scientist and a street sweeper as equal? The hypocrisy of socialists and communists is that they live in a highly unequal society, where high party officials have their own lanes on roads, their own shops, and they send their children to the best private schools, the rest of the proles are all equal in shite, in poverty and derision. Socialism also creates poverty, because it normalises it, and it encourages those in poverty to stay in poverty by giving them benefit payments to do so. This is a never ending generational cycle of poverty that can only be broken by proper education, enterprise and a market where capitalistic competition is present. Anyone who has any sense would run a thousand miles away from Corbyn, but to do so you would have to possess an education, and knowledge of history, as well as a honed sense of logic, which socialists do not possess. You socialist do-gooder poseurs are merely posturing, when it comes to the crunch you are more racist than conservatives, more un-progressive, and pander to soviet political correctness, censorship. Let us hope for Britain’s sake we never see a Labour government ever again, for it is with this unholy pathetic misadventure that will push the country deep into the mire to never recover from the path it has taken. If you want chaos, death, and poverty, please vote for Jeremy Corbyn’s Britain, because under his watch after he invites another 80% of the third world into the country, there will be no NHS, no schools or places to live. This place is already full, and by piling rats upon rats, eventually they start to eat each other. That is Labour’s Britain, a festering polluted vomit prison where humans are piled upon each other by the million, all the grass is now mud and excrement and over the collective moaning you will hear the voice of Corbyn saying how wonderful life is under socialism. Fuck you Corbyn. Never, never, never shall you be allowed to create your Marxist utopia that never existed in human history or will ever exist. Socialism and Communism have been responsible for over 140 million human deaths throughout history, and this is the crux of the whole situation, they murdered those people for their ideology and party.

He’s not very tall but I’ve heard he is a great friend of Trump’s and helped him immensely during the election,” another journalist said. Taking the podium, the newly appointed FBI director, Brad Poutin, seemed resolute and determined to treat the job just like any other he has had in the past. “I have a saying from where I come.

The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workingmen of all countries, unite!” The thunderous words coming from the Comrade brought cheers from party officials as they shouted ‘Hail! Comrade Corbyn!

Corbyn then continued his speech with great vitriol: “From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs. For the many, not the few. The rich will do anything for the poor but get off their backs. We will abolish all private property. We will nationalise all business.

What we have in effect, is another Vichy government while France is under occupation,” an election observer revealed. It is not just the ideological slant of the French to socialism and its brutish father, communism, but the Germans have since World War II been allied in their own special way. Instead of allying with the British who liberated them in 1944, the French have chosen to side with their eternal oppressors. It must be a sado-masochistic streak that somehow makes up the Gallic constitution. The French of course turned a blind eye during the war when the little Jewish children were picked off from their schools and sent to concentration camps, never to be seen again. After all, it was the Catholic thing to do, plus after surrendering so easily to the Germans without a shot being fired, a coward keeps their mouth shut. Paris under occupation Paris, untouched by any bomb or bullet was thus an idyllic WW2 playground for the Bosch and their French underlings. The whore houses were full, bristling with business, the cafes resplendent with German SS officers and the quaint boulevards bristled with the joie de vivre. The EU has once again crushed the small pocket of French resistance. It is quite ironic, that this time, the French resistance was labelled with fascistic terms, and those who fought bravely against the German fascists of WW2 all those years ago were otherwise. How the pendulum has swung, however, one thing has always stayed constant with the French, and that is their servitude to their Germanic masters.

Hours after a Brussels summit in which EU leaders – some calling the UK’s stance “unreal” – again insisted it will have to settle up the ransom money they have concocted out of thin air before the UK will be allowed to leave the totalitarian EU state. Meanwhile, members of the European Commission, a group of unelected technocrats, had other priorities on their mind. “We must have agreeable French cuisine available at all meetings. Jean Claude-Juncker likes to not only have the best French haute cuisine and personal chef available at all hours of the day, maybe to rustle up a poularde roasted with caraway, tamarind jus, green lentils, turnips et cabbage, or a Challans duck, foie gras poached in Rivesaltes, avec some crispy pear. Hmmm délicieux..One must also not forget the obligatory jug of cognac and a cigar or two at every meeting, only the best for Monsieur Juncker,” Allen Batentout, Senior unelected EU Analyst told the BBC. The view from Europe The chances of talks failing are “over 50%”, EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and his team have concluded after a reportedly disastrous pre-summit dinner with PM Theresa May. “I’m leaving Downing Street 10 times more sceptical than I was before,” a disgusted Juncker told the prime minister, apparently appalled by the UK’s “simplistic” take on key issues such as Britain’s divorce bill and the future rights of EU citizens as well as the “despicable” food presented at the meeting. The main topic, of course, was the quality of food that was presented to the visiting EU dignitaries.

On leaving Number 10, Juncker – not shy in showing his disapproval, projectile vomited over two policemen, a reporter and the resident cat. His gut wrenching vomit was so powerful that one policeman had to receive counselling after being doused in bits of carrot, some sweetcorn and lashings of mashed potato. “One of the protection officers had his mouth open and swallowed a considerable amount of Juncker vomit. It stunk of fresh cognac, Baron Otard to be precise. That was not the worst of it though, even Larry the Number 10 cat was doused in the puke, but he did not look perturbed by it at all, he just simply bent his head down to eat up as much as he could.

The bookies are already rolling out odds for their possible feats next season, however, before you do place a bet online, it’s important as ever to check out bookmaker reviews to make sure you get the best odds and promotions as it can make a huge difference your winnings. The Magpies are 1/6 to stay up next season whilst Brighton are 4/6, with Rafa Benitez’s men 7/2 to take the back drop down to the Championship, though the Seagulls are almost evens at 11/10. Benitez is being tipped for a successful season with the Magpies next season and the Spaniard is said to be confident he will be afforded what he needs from boss Mike Ashley so that he is able to remain on the touchline at St. James’ Park. The pair are set to meet next week to discuss plans to move the club forward on their immediate return to the top flight and it is reported that Benitez will be handed a £70 million war chest to splash out in the transfer window. Ashley is said to have a good understanding of Bentiez’s plan and the former Liverpool manager is said to have huge ambitions with the North East club and making them a top-eight club again is at the very top. It will be a difficult ask for Benitez, admittedly, they do have everything in the making of a top eight club, a huge stadium, a loyal fan base, a billionaire owner and a very talented manager, though they do lack quality in many areas of the pitch. That said, that £70 million transfer budget is likely to solve that problem easily and at 7/2 for a top-half finish, the Magpies may just be good value for their money. As for Brighton, it’s their first ever stint in the Premier League and what a truly remarkably story it’s been for the Seagulls. Some twenty years ago, it took the club until the very last day of the 1996/97 season to secure Football League survival. The trio of Dick Knight, Bob Pinnock and Martin Perry shook hands on a deal to rescue Brighton with two just games remaining and ever since that fateful day, they took the club from strength to strength. Now, the club is a position that fans back then could have only dreamed of, and even with the wildest of dreamers, it’s something would have been hard to envisage. Whilst Brighton may be completely unfamiliar with the Premier League, Chris Hughton is no stranger. The 58-year-old guided Newcastle to the top flight in 2010 and secured a very respectable 11th place finish with Norwich during the 2012/13 season. Hughton has turned his Brighton side into an excellent defensive unit and since taking charge in late 2014, they have 47 clean sheets in 113 league games, if they can continue this in the Premier League they’ll be more than sound. Glenn Murray will be keen to replicate his goal-scoring efforts in the top flight also, the 33-year-old boasts 22 goals and five assists this term. Anthony Knockaert is another talent fans in the top flight are keen to see, the Frenchman has 15 goals to his name this season, with a further eight assists and teammates Tomer Hemed and Sam Baldock aren’t far behind. They’re definitely ones to keep an eye out for.'], ['The Rise of Online Gaming', ' Leading the way is MMORPG, massively multiplayer online role playing games but for their all dominance, the internet has opened up endless possibilities for all other genres in the gaming market, breathing life into those once considered archaic.

You know you get up at the crack of dawn and start getting messages of leaky pipes, toilet problems and dishwasher installations. I particularly enjoy the jobs where I get knees deep under the sink to fix that pesky problem.” Tommy is a devout Scatologist, which is a cult that programs people. The religion was started by Ron. L. Hubbub in 1968. “If there’s a problem in the toilet bowl, I speak out to the Klingons to exorcise them and clear the blockages. It really helps. One day I was speaking out to the great Operating Cretin in the sky, and got my E-meter (specialist plumbing tool) out. It read that the toilet pipe was in the throes of an intergalactic metabolic dictatorship that only Xenu (toilet plunger) could save. Suffice to say, after a good plugging the enormous turd blocking the pipe junction was released into the sewer and Mrs. Mable at 42, could have her toilet back.” Tommy left school at 16, and immediately knew what he wanted to do with his life. “I left school became a plumber and that’s it. I’ve never left to do anything else. I once thought about being an actor, you know star in movies like my favourite is Mission Impossible, but instead I’m a reacher, you know reach round here, reach round there, get a vice-grip here, get a bog brush there. It’s simple but a very satisfying job.”'], ['5 Apps for Every Dedicated Prime Minister', 'With the local elections out of the way and General Election fever gripping the nation, it would be easy to get sucked in and forget that anything else in British politics matters.

Every day, Brussels comes up with some ridiculous sum that Britain should pay as a penance for daring to leave the authoritarian pseudo-communist Soviet EU state. £65 billion here, £125 million there, as these ridiculous sums are parried about, this is a sure-fire lesson in why the EU is essentially a racket, a mafia-like regime of thieves who imprison nations and make it almost impossible to leave. The onus is on voters once again brought into the fray to vote for a strong conservative government to finally break the malaise that has not only entrenched the country but given the unelected communist Eurocrats carte blanche to threaten Britain with ransom bills every other day. The EU do not negotiate, they utilise delaying tactics, they suddenly adjourn meetings and leave, they do not play on a level playing field, as they continually will move the goal posts until they get their desired outcome. This sort of nefarious dishonest technique employed by the EU, makes negotiation nigh on impossible. Britain must preserve what it has left and leave the toxic EU with haste, with zero negotiation where blackmail is present. We must not be party to ransom, we must not capitulate or compromise with a state that threatens us on a daily basis. On June 23, 2016, the historic EU Referendum vote showed an emphatic answer of defiance to 40 years of authoritarian rule by the EU over Britain’s sovereignty, its law, and its ability to control its borders. We must not dishonour that vote on June 23, as it changed the course of history, where Britain would once again become a self determined country and not a slave to a Sovietised EU totalitarian Union. No deal. No, no, no. There shall be no deal with terrorists, and no deal with the EU, and they can implement as much Project Fear as they want on the populace, we do not negotiate with blackmailers and those who hold us to ransom. The EU has not only threatened the UK with vast sums of ransom cash but have tried to destabilise British territories like Gibraltar. This form of threat is not only below the belt, but it shows what the EU is, a rogue state, floundering and lashing out. The message is loud and clear. If the EU is prepared to put aside the threats, blackmail and ransom notes, there could be a deal. If the EU continues with its daily ransom demands, No Deal.'], ['Corbyn Calls Boris Johnson a ‘Fopdoodling Old Scobberlotcher!’', ' “We don’t usually look at dictionaries, our only reference book is George Orwell’s 1984, and the Karl Marx/Engels Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei translated into easy to read English. “Mr. Johnson certainly caught us on the backfoot, and after much deliberation and debate, we came up with a suitable retort,” a Labour election adviser told the Guardian. Today at a press conference in Scunthorpe, Jeremy Corbyn angrily took the microphone and called Boris Johnson a ‘fopdoodling old scobberlotcher’ to much laughter from the assembled comrades and proles. When asked what those words meant, the Labour leader was absolutely clueless, as these are words he was told to say by his election campaign aides. “As I said earlier, I only read communist books and manifestos. I have no time to read literature of any other kind, and when I am in power, most intellectuals and literate people will be executed, because we don’t like people cleverer than us around.

Well, they wheeled in the brain and a body and I plonked it unceremoniously in the skull cavity. When the patient woke up he started oinking and said it was the wrong fucking body donor,” professor Cannelloni told NeuroScience Weekly magazine. What the dozy surgeon had done was to transplant the brain of a pig into the body of an EU politician. “The funny thing was, there was barely any difference in the awakened cadaver’s usual routine. He immediately went towards a trough we have for waste products and started to scoff away, much like a real eurocrat in real life.

Under the auspices of Corbyn and his counterpart, comrade Keir Starmer, the EU will play all the cards of the softest Brexit that could possibly occur. In fact, after the communist controlled ‘Brexit’ there will be no difference to the UK before ‘Brexit’. Labour Brexiteers must thus join with the Conservatives in thwarting not only a Labour soft Brexit, which means no Brexit, but also thwarting the SNP from any sort of action that may break up the United Kingdom. The two must work together as one in stopping the soviet machinations of the Marxist comrade Keir Starmer, a high party Labour official who not only wants to ruin a true Brexit but will leave the UK worse off than it ever was. No deal is better than a bad deal, and Britain will always have access to the single market, as every country in the world already has. We will forge new deals on a global basis without the inhibitive forces of the EU breathing down our necks. This election is crucial to the safety of the UK, not only in immigration terms, in military defence but also in preserving the Brexit the people voted for on June 23, 2016 in the EU Referendum.

Some people eat the bark off trees, or they grind up grass if they can find any and boil it in a pot. We have had reports of cannibalism in the past, but these are usually stories that come from the gulags across the country,” a peasant who lives 64 km from the capital told a recent group of visitors to the country. Of course, there is a huge fear of being caught if you divulge any information, however, some North Koreans are able to defect South of the militarised zone and there they can reveal information about the secretive Communist state. Much of the North Korean country is filled with camps for people who have either erred in the ways of politics or have been caught with illegal contraband. “The propaganda the state delivers to the West is very false. The gulags that the Kim family have built are terrible places where hundreds of thousands of people are sent every year to die of starvation and overwork. This is the core of North Korea, any form of dissent will send you to one of these hellish places, and many are reported by their own neighbours or family members. Something must be done to free these people some day. I am asking from help from President Trump. Please stop the suffering of the North Korean people once and for all,” another dissident revealed. While the North Korean leader lives in complete luxury in his palaces with plentiful gourmet food, his people are resorting to cannibalism to survive. This situation must not be allowed to go on any more, and hopefully military action very soon will free the people from the scourge of the Kim family that has afflicted the country for so long.'], ['5 Ways in Which You Can Rock at Singles Nights', 'H owever, such dating events can be quite fun and who knows, may even help you find that special someone. If you’ve decided to go to a singles night in your town, congrats! Here are five small tips to help you ease yourself back into the scene. 1 Relax as much as you can Be honest, you’ve caused more than half the stress you’re feeling right now yourself by thinking too much about how you’re going to act at the singles event. Just relax! If you’re relaxed and have an overall chill attitude, chances of impressing someone cool that’s caught your eye are even higher. So just lay back and be the best version of yourself. 2 Keep an open mind Most of us like to think that we’ve got a type and try to stick to that. I, for example, always thought I liked tall, muscular, brunette men with beards and green eyes. While this type of preference is understandable in your twenties, after a certain age the dating pool becomes narrower, and you might find yourself to be interested in someone that is the polar opposite of what you’ve been attracted to thus far. Just remember it’s ok to go outside your dating comfort zone, and have fun with it. 3 Don’t judge people Many people attending singles events in London are past a certain age, and might be divorced and even have a few children on their hands. Remember not to judge people too soon once you find out they’ve been down the aisle before. Everyone is pursuing a new chance at happiness, just like you. 4 Flirt as much you can Singles nights are first and foremost about having fun and making the most out of your experience. Therefore, don’t be shy to get back out there and flirt as much as you can with whoever catches your eye. Even if you don’t end up building a committed relationship out of it, it’s still going to be very spiritually rewarding to play around a little bit and flirt with interesting new people. 5 Don’t get drunk I know that drinking a little bit to get your courage up might sound like a good idea before a dating event, especially if you’re going for the first time and don’t know what to expect. However, remember that showing up drunk to such an event will only help you make a fool out of yourself. Nobody likes a drunk party pooper!'], ['French Election Schengen Zone Terrorism – Marine Le Pen the Only Answer', ' There is only one person who can halt this Schengen nightmare that has befallen the once great and beautiful country of France, and that is Marine Le Pen. Preservation The land that housed the greatest artists of all time, painters, architects and cuisine is being besieged daily by a torrent of unwanted migrants and terrorists crossing into its borders. The boulevards, once attended by cafés and lounging Parisians now filled to the brim with the smell of faeces, and urine from the makeshift tents laid out amongst bickering African migrants fighting for some space which they think is owed to them. How far into the toilet must one country go before someone stands up and says ‘Enough is enough!’ or ‘trop c’est trop!’? It is time for the socialists to step aside, and for real action to take place, for a party that can save France from this disastrous decline and fall into the mire. Perhaps, a Joan D’Arc character like Marine Le Pen, can finally bring an end to the terrible malaise that has befallen this once great nation, smeared by the EU for too long. How many terrorist atrocities will it take for the French to finally come to their senses, to have cartoonists murdered in cold blood, or pedestrians crushed under trucks, or music lovers executed mercilessly? France. Wake up. There is a whole world outside the prison of the European Union, a failed project that not only has imprisoned France but inhibited it from its true potential.

A Soviet Labour government would not “play by their rules,” he added. No more elections once Labour in power “We would also change election rules once Labour is back in power. Once we win, there will be no more need for elections in Soviet Britain ever again. This election could therefore be the last ever election you see in your lifetime,” Corbyn stressed. The biased leftist BBC is fully behind Corbyn’s bid to thwart Theresa May’s hope to convert the Tories’ double digit poll lead into a bigger Commons majority. Corbyn’s Labour government would halt Brexit and stop Theresa May strengthening her hand in Brexit negotiations providing the “strong and stable leadership” the country needs. Instead, the majority Labour Remoaners would seek to fully reverse any notions of leaving the European Union and renegotiate with Brussels on full implementation into stronger EU union. Bolshevik Revolution The Labour leader looks set to run an anti-bourgeoisie campaign, presenting himself as a champion of the powerless proletariat against political and business culture. He attacked the “morally bankrupt” Conservatives who he said would not stand up to those who seek wealth from hard work and other members of a “gilded elite,” who were extracting wealth “from the unfortunate circumstances of ordinary unemployed and unemployable people” who are the root of Labour’s voting underclass. Labour would “end this racket” and “overturn the rigged system,” he told an audience of Labour supporters in London. “Once we’re in power, everyone will be equal in poverty and suffering. There will be no more aspirations or silly things like that,” Comrade Corbyn added. Marxist paradise He also said Labour was the only party that would “focus on the kind of country we want to have” – dismissing Mrs May’s election campaign as an “ego trip about her own failing leadership”. “Let us look at the other socialist utopia — Venezuela. We want our nation to resemble that South American dream of extreme poverty, anarchy and chaos.” And he insisted all of Labour’s policies, including an increase in corporation tax for big business and more money for carers and a £10 an hour minimum wage, were fully costed. “If you own a property today, once we win you will not own that property any more. The owning of all private property is theft from the poorest of our society. For too long, wealth has been allowed to accumulate in private housing. Our collectivist Soviet system will free up wealth from private citizens and all property ownership will transfer to the state, to be redistributed to the populace as needed.” Corbyn the Bolshevik survivor Addressing Labour’s poor opinion poll ratings, he said he was given a 200/1 chance of becoming Labour leader in 2015 and he defied those odds. “They have tried to oust me many times, but I as supreme Comrade to the Soviet Labour Marxist social-democratic party have endured and survived many attempts to remove me. They shall not prevail, as they have failed in the past, so today I survive and will survive to lead our great Soviet nation onwards.” His message was uncompromising. Jeremy Corbyn attacked targets from what he called the ruling bourgeois elite. In doing so, he was trying to recapture the energy and rhetoric which enabled him to win not one, but two, Labour leadership contests. He said a future Labour government wouldn’t play by the rules and denounced his Conservative opponents as morally bankrupt. Corbyn vowed to end the scourge of capitalism once and for all by ousting all bankers from the City, the media and business people were also in his sights – it created dividing lines not just with his current political opponents but with his party’s New Labour past. “I will throw these financiers, capitalist scum, business profiteers into the back streets where they will be beaten, stripped of all wealth and seen off.” Corbyn’s speech received a standing ovation from the invited audience of Labour members and was designed, in part, to motivate newer recruits in particular to campaign over the next seven weeks. It could also shore up the party’s core support. There were spontaneous shouts of ‘Hail! Comrade Corbyn’ and ‘Bravo! Our Supreme white socked Soviet Comrade!”'], ['Farewell to Bill O’Reilly', 'As psychopaths go, it is relatively rare to see and study one up close on screen nearly every day on TV. Most psychopaths reside mainly in the board room of top companies, or government high office, covered away in their ivory towers of business and governmental power politics. Bill O’Reilly, was an outstanding example of psychopathy and his daily rants instilled in Americans a fervent ideal point of view that only a cold hearted murderous psycho could deliver. In times of war, there was O’Reilly enjoying every moment of his airtime by telling Americans to obey their masters wholeheartedly without question, telling any dissenters to ‘shut the fuck up’ and employing a murderous outlook on anyone who even looked like an Arab. His psychopathic rage bolstered by his devout Irish Catholic fanaticism. Behind the scenes in the Fox news network, O’Reilly threw his unwanted advances onto female co-workers with a cold deranged loveless vigour, something a rapist would do, but he was a news anchor so he had the right to do what he wanted, that is until he got caught. Not easy to work with, O’Reilly rose to the top of the Fox network through brutal office games, burying his opponents in the sand, his psychopathic nature feeling no shame or conscience as he stepped on the skulls of those he had slain to rise up top. “Psychopathic narcissists like Bill O’Reilly do not feel emotions like real people. They have learned masks and mannerisms to look like they feel, but in truth they have little or no emotion when it comes to the people they crush on the way up. They cause mayhem and discord in the office to further their own needs, and their cold calculating nature helps them get promoted, simply because they do anything for their bosses,” leading psychiatrist in the field of psychopathy, Professor Neil Jenkins, revealed on Thursday.'], ['Experts: North Korea Attack is Not WW3', 'With all the ridiculous headlines hailing the beginning of WW3 just because North Korea may be attacked in the not too distant future by America, let us analyse why these hysterical notions and labels are so overblown. For a start, any war with North Korea would be over in less than a month. This is because of their ageing military equipment. The puny N.Korean air force still uses some ancient MIGs and an assortment of outdated Soviet planes. The U.S. would dominate North Korean airspace within days. The N. Korean nuclear aspirations are not worthy of comment, simply because they do not have the ballistic rocket technology to hit any U.S. territory long distance. A world war should actually mean a world war, where every nation would be embroiled some way or another. By fighting N.Korea, there is a small chance of escalation, however it is a certainty most NATO allies would choose to only concentrate on Kim Jung-un and his outdated tin pot army. An attack on N. Korea certainly will not mean WW3, that is unless, Russia and China join the North Korean side, and although this may happen, strategically, the Chinese and Russians see N. Korea as much a nuisance as the U.S. If the Americans defeat the North Korean regime, this will leave U.S. bases on the doorstep of China and Russia. Something like that will be a highly undesirable outcome but will be liveable for the two nations. Naturally, in a war scenario, there are not only many variables to consider, but also events happen, plans do not always work out, and chaos ensues. Helmuth von Moltke the Elder once said: No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy. Believe us in saying, you will know when the REAL WW3 starts when China and Russia join forces for the final fight. Every day is a march towards this final conflict, as every day the earth’s finite resources are depleted by the ever growing human population.'], ['Theresa May: Snap Election Could Go Crackle and Pop', 'What the fuck has Theresa May gone and done now? She has ordered up a snap election on June 8th. Are you serious Mrs. May? Oh yes she is and what a clever girl she is too. In one fell swoop she could bury Labour for the next hundred odd years and destroy that Scottish nationalist anti-English maniac, Sturgeon, once and for all. Of course, it could all go belly up as well. Theresa May may suddenly become really unpopular and Labour could oust Corbyn bringing in a secret super candidate they have been keeping in a dungeon somewhere. This would be the ultimate tragedy, but if the election is to be held in two months time, this leaves little or no chance that the electorate will get to know them, unless they are relatively well known already. What about the SNP? Well, when Theresa May wins the election, she will have a proper mandate, thus be able to swat away the meddlesome midget from Scotland with more ease. The Scottish referendum that nobody apart from Sturgeon wants could be delayed until 2052 for all it’s worth. By then, hopefully Sturgeon will be dead and no one will give a hoot. What about Corbyn? Despite not winning many popularity contests amongst his party, he still has a following, and he is not to be underestimated. The communist and lib dem remainers will no doubt pick this old fart to be their choice in an election, more of a protest vote, but the majority of the country will vote for May, and not some Marxist commie bastard who wants to line people up in the street and have them stripped of all wealth then unceremoniously shot in the back of the head. Lest we forget other elements that may sway an election. The EU for a start who have infiltrated vast swathes of this country’s institutions like the BBC, could have another Project Fear campaign against May and Brexiteers. Naturally, those who have some understanding of politics will be able to see through the EU fearmongering, however, the EU has a lot of money at their disposal, and they like to throw it around a lot. This is dangerous, because it could sway opinion. Again, we are at an impasse, this heady Brexit roller coaster ride has indeed brought up the bile, one minute we’re sailing into the open sea, the next, we’re back to square one.

This is when it went to the next level, Kaku who is Japanese, suddenly connected with a karate punch to Dawkins’ balls and the fight was over,” Bella Donna, a science enthusiast who attended the event, told New Scientist magazine. Sadly the book signing was cut short due to the fracas and the police swooping on the two scientists. One astrophysicist present said: “At least they should have discussed something more scientific.

Being one of our largest motivators throughout all mankind our bodies have various ways of providing us with this sensation, such as producing endorphins. You might have heard someone describe how something felt like “such a rush”. Maybe you heard a story about someone who broke a bone and didn’t realize until hours afterwards. In either case, it’s safe to say endorphins were involved.. Often referred to the brains “pleasure chemical”, endorphins are produced by the pituitary gland in moments of excitement, but also during moments of pain or anxiety and at times of remarkable mental or physical stress. It is what turns our excitement into pleasure, relieves our pain and pushes our bodies beyond its capabilities when necessary. A common way of recreating this process naturally is Extreme Sports. It may be activities such as Bungee Jumping, Skydiving, Mountain Climbing or Cliff Diving. There are numerous ways “deceive” our brain into thinking we are in remarkable danger, lethal even. When our brain perceives that are under remarkable stress and danger it’ll go into overdrive producing not only endorphins, but also other hormones, dopamine and beta-endorphins. Our pulse starts racing as the heart beats faster, getting blood into both our brain and muscles much quicker than usual. As our reaction quickens, time slows down. We’re able to perceive our surroundings with senses heightened far above normal level. Maybe now you’ll understand why some people enjoy throwing themselves out of airplanes! Working somewhat similar to how extreme sports triggers these effects would be Exercise, exerting ourselves beyond our limits triggers very similar responses.

These animals went about their daily business without gods, religions or prophets. It was only when man gained full consciousness and the ability to linguistically articulate that gods and prophets were introduced to the human condition. “This incredible moment of creating gods was to compensate for the unknown. Here was man, under the stars looking up into this great black mass and it was unknown. Anything unknown is a superstitious jump in the human brain where the void is simply filled by gods and their actions. The rain that falls one day, or the lightning in the sky, these were unknowns to early man, and all attributed to the gods. Volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and of course great floods. “If one was to analyse the human brain in all cultures, there is a propensity to create religion in man. It is most certainly an in built function of the human brain, and analyzing each different culture and religion we see the same spots light up in the brain scans. “Even though ancient cultures were divided by oceans and mountains, we see the same patterns in South America as we do in South East Asia, and through to Europe and the Middle East, as well as Australasia. The unknown can only be answered by creating gods, and the unknowns help to deal with the ultimate unknown — death. “When you die, does your soul essence, this electrical mind, the little wisp of light arise from the body or is there full brain death and then just nothing? We will most probably never as a species fully understand that, but in all certainty, one thing is sure in death, and that is the vehicle i.e. the body is vacated and something departs or is merely switched off. Within this universe, nothing can be totally destroyed, if one pours a cup of water onto the floor, the droplets evaporate and eventually come back down to earth again, the same must be said about what inhabits the body of a creature that is alive. That spark, that initial electrical charge, either switches off or is released through some sort of universal memory into the ether. “If the earth were to explode today. The universe would still exist as it has done for millennia, there would be little or no change. The universe does not care, it just exists. Man made religions are just questions, they cannot be deemed as fact, they are stories made by humans to react to the utter magnificence of our world and reality, as well as the unknown. Reading any religious book, one must take into account the culture that created that book, the superstitions of the culture, and also the race of the book creators. The linguistic style of the written religious book also gives away many things to the creation time of the piece and the people who created it. “There are no prophets today or religious bibles written, because we have science to disprove nonsense, however this same science did not exist in the Middle Ages or prior and generational brainwashing has been allowed to take place. Religions today are basically systems of control that have survived in human culture because they are very effective tools in managing large swathes of people. Religions certainly do not want progress, or lateral thinking or any form of logic, for them this would awaken the masses who are their lifeblood and money supply.”'], ['Communist Remoaners Have a Go at Sir Michael Caine', ' Listen here you snivelling wart, Remoaner communist eu-loving scum, before you have a go at Sir Michael Caine, you come over here to the Daily Squib offices and we’ll put some sense into you idiots.

General George S. Patton There is no doubt that Syria’s leader, Assad is a butcher, an evil killer who sees his own people as mere pieces of meat, to be barrel bombed and gassed, but is Trump’s action of sending 58 odd Tomahawk missiles onto a Syrian airfield justified? Hell yeah, and not only that, we need Trump to put boots on the ground to clean out Assad once and for all, either to take him to The Hague or string him up from one of his palaces. Our intelligence sources think that Assad is probably not in Syria, the coward that he is, he is probably holed up in some Eastern European country or deep in Russia somewhere, so this may be a problem. As for Russia, Putin’s protests about any U.S. action should be firmly ignored. Putin needs to shut up and take a back seat, his efforts in Syria are pathetic, and his ageing military are defunct next to the American forces that should sweep through like a knife through butter. Under Obama, there was silence, cowardice and apathy. Under Trump we have war, serious movement towards change and all out conflict. War will be a breath of fresh air from a once stale Obama led spending spree on nothing. Obama in all his years achieved absolutely nothing but spending of U.S. tax dollars on his cronies. North Korea is the joker in the pack, Trump can take that out in three weeks. Once N. Korea becomes a de facto U.S. military base on the door step of China, the global order will slowly change. Russia was allowed to recover from communism, China was allowed to sell their cheap plastic trinkets to the West to increase their military strength. The U.S. needs valid strong enemies, and is prepared to absorb a first strike, but when it comes to war, nothing beats the equipment the U.S. will finally unleash upon their enemies. With dwindling finite resources on the planet, there can only be one singular global winner…and it’s not going to be Russia or China.

When it comes to gaming, no two experiences are ever the same, regardless of how many times you play a title. Opponents, tactics, hands, shuffles, dealers and dice rolls are likely to be different each time we switch on, increasing the potential to learn and develop skills. For anyone who’s ever been told that video games, online casinos and simulators rot your brain, here is the counter-argument. Video games Video games are a great entertainment medium; used as stress relievers, mood boosters and boredom banishers, video games are the go-to hobby for millions of people all around the world. But have you ever stopped to think about the skills that can be learned from each video game you play? From obvious transferable skills, like hand-eye coordination, problem solving, strategy, social networking and special awareness, to those that relate to specific games and genres, there are many legitimate reasons beyond enjoyment to carry on playing the games you know and love. Some of the more specific skills include learning an instrument, navigation, code breaking, vehicle maintenance, all kinds of sports, engineering, complex mathematics, languages, programming, coding, typing and even singing and dancing. The computer games industry is a vast and varied one, and the skills you could be learning almost innumerable, even if some of them will be basic at best. Casino games Surely casinos can’t teach transferable skills? You’d be surprised. Games like poker are fantastic for a whole range of skills that can be applied to everyday situations, such as lateral and logical thinking, complex mathematics, concentration and problem solving, as well as plenty of patience and the ability to hide your intentions. Oh, and memory; rather apt that that’s almost forgotten. Hundreds of books have been written about poker, not to mention articles and blog posts, such as those that can be found on 888poker. Although primarily about playing the game, such literary efforts say a great deal about real life too – the skills they teach have as much of a place in real life as they do at the poker table. Simulation games In the real world, simulation games are not so much an advantage as they are a necessity. Even their use for entertainment has its benefits. While many simulation games are designed with an express aim in mind, such as medical training, teaching business strategy, providing retail experience and simulating flight preparation, others are subtler when it comes to to transferable skills. Games such as The Sims, Farming Simulator, FIFA, Transport Tycoon, SimCity and Theme Park teach players problem solving, holistic thinking, conflict resolution and methodology, as well as educating them on a certain subject matter. All these skills are useful, if not essential, to our understanding of the world around us, and some of the challenges it presents. So, the next someone suggests you spend less time gaming and more time in the real world, you can inform them that your hobby is the reason you now have a comprehensive knowledge of European football, have a reasonable idea of how to pilot a passenger plane circumnavigate the globe and know how to solve complex mathematical equations. They may scoff, but you will definitely know better.'], ['History is Made – Theresa May Finally Triggers Article 50', 'Above the collective sound of Remainers moaning that awful pitiful communist wailing sound, and the vindictive Sturgeon, an English-hating barren midget plotting evil plans, and the EU hierarchy issuing hourly threats of what they will do to Britain — Theresa May has finally triggered Article 50. What she should have done as soon as she came into office, she has finally done, and wasted countless months on nothing but useless court cases, derailing plots, useless parliamentary votes, and the chance for Scot Sturgeon to regroup and exercise her plans to break-up the United Kingdom. The fight to free the UK from the totalitarian shackles of the EU are however not over with a simple signing of a piece of paper. There are now more plots to derail the exit process than there were to derail the triggering of Article 50. This impasse, is mainly because Article 50 should have been a Shock and Awe signing quickly after the EU referendum was won. One thing is certain and that is the UK is not liable for any leaving penalty costs as the EU is stipulating, and it is in fact the EU that owes Britain billions of pounds. Still governed by thousands of EU laws it will take years to dump the effluent that has crept into the British system so that it can finally govern itself again. Freedom from slavery and servitude always has a cost, and much like the institutionalised prisoner leaving his cell after forty years in prison, it is going to be hard for the subservient government officials to finally think for themselves without answering to their German and French bosses. Traitors like Lord Heseltine, Blair, Clegg, Mandelson, Osborne, Cameron, would have happily collaborated with Germany in World War II, and if things had gone their way today would have condemned Britain to become a mere sector in a German-led new EU Reich, a defeat for Britain without a single shot being fired. The Germans have sought to conquer Britain for many years, through two wars, and through economic/political means through the EU. That third war was fought without guns, but it nevertheless was a war. Onward, the ship finally sails, the open sea beckons, the horizon is clear.

This is crucial in also bringing forth further inhibitive laws, because the fearful people and congress will accept anything to keep themselves ‘safe’. “If it was not for Pearl Harbour, the U.S. would not have joined the war in 1941. If it was not for 911, the U.S. would not have invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, and created many laws inhibiting human freedoms in the country. “This is why Trump and his team have to engineer an opportunity to profit from an event, or as G.W. Bush did, allow it to occur by telling all the military safeguards to stand down on the day. Maybe another gas attack in Syria where civilians are seen in distress. “After the event takes place, there will be a huge patriotic response and Trump will be vindicated. The triumphant leader will have his position sealed for the history books. “War is the medicine for change, as only true change is achieved by the means of extreme violence.”'], ['Obama For Prison', 'The intelligence is said to leave no doubt the Obama administration, in its closing days, was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on President-elect Trump.

Obviously, the augurs do not bode well for Obama, who has denied any wrongdoing, however with the evidence presented in plain black and white, how can he deny the charges against him? As for prison time, according to the U.S. Constitution presidents, current or past are liable for crimes committed. They can of course argue ‘executive privilege’ however under the circumstances of Obama, and the severity of the accusations, he would not be able to hide behind any special legal excuse for his crimes. Tyrone Jackson, 27, an inmate of San Quentin State Prison in California doing 120 years for crimes of murder and rape, says he “can’t wait to be cell buddies with Barack,” and show him a “good time”. Looks like its going to be breaking rocks time with his butt cheeks for the disgraced Obama sometime in 2017. Whilst tucked away in some maximum security prison, Obama will no doubt be preaching the benefits of homosexuality and anal sex to his fellow inmates, who no doubt will take him up on the offer.

Central London is already a veritable fortress, and yet yesterday a knife wielding brainwashed Jihadist was able to infiltrate the courtyard for parliament in Westminster palace and murder in cold blood an unarmed policeman. Britons, especially in London, pride themselves in tolerance, however, there is a vast network of Jihadists within its borders, who can act either as lone wolves or as a group. Until these elements are dispatched with extreme prejudice, the attacks will continue. The police must all carry firearms from now on. Every officer must be trained in the effective usage of hand guns and sub machine guns. The PM must make a point to increase funding not only for a fully armed police force, but vast increases in budgets for intelligence gathering agencies to effectively target the Islamist threat embedded deep within Britain. On a positive point, Britain is leaving the EU, and will be able to secure its borders soon. Jihadist elements have flowed into the country easily since Labour PM, Tony Blair, opened the doors for all and sundry during his disastrous tenure. The porous Schengen zone is a direct corridor from Syria to Britain, with little or no checks and is destroying countries within its zone little by little. The slow moving, unelected EU officials who are more concerned with their salaries and benefits packages than their civilian populace are blind to reason and logic.

Anyway, this hunchbacked gentleman in dark glasses comes up to me with a heavy Dutch accent and asks if I want to be in a film. I asked how much it pays immediately, and he gave me a six figure sum.

According to reports from the Sun newspaper, filming will start soon, and all Osborne will be required to do is produce many of his famous cum faces, whilst other actors do the sordid messy bits. “There will be fluffers on the set, whether Georgie boy gets a sniff of that is a mystery,” one of the crew members in the production revealed on Tuesday.

His eyes at this point were completely blank, and the blue veins on his forehead were about to explode. That’s when I decided to call 911. I tried to get the cat off and was calling out, that’s when Dobbie, our Golden Retriever came into the room. Dobbie loves sausages and when he saw the long white strand coming from Earl’s ear, he jumped on it and chomped down.

Of course, the fact that Madrid ended up 15 points behind Barcelona in the league had nothing to do with their awful start to the season, when they won just one of their first four games and lost away at minnows Getafe. Your fault, Iker… The Chelsea return Mourinho won the title at Stamford Bridge in 2014/15, but the following season was nothing short of a disaster. After poor pre-season preparation, an over-reliance on ageing players and a failure to make any signings of note, one might have expected the Portuguese to front up as Chelsea made the worst start to a season of any Premier League champion. Instead, Mourinho caused controversy by publicly admonishing Chelsea physio Eva Carneiro during a draw with Swansea, an incident that later led to a protracted court case and a private settlement between the two. During his time with the Blues, Mourinho also criticised Hazard, Diego Costa, the FA, referees and – bizarrely – his own children. Mourinho was finally sacked in December but, of course, it was the players’ fault that England’s reigning champions had slumped to 16th in the table. Manchester United and the future The controversial Mourinho has continued to plant a siege mentality at his new club. From sidelining star players Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Anthony Martial to insisting that a loss at Hull was actually a draw, Mourinho has been box office at Old Trafford, even suggesting that having to live in the Lowry Hotel like a continental Alan Partridge was having an impact on his side’s results. This 888sport article asked if Mourinho had lost the plot at Manchester United. With United struggling to keep pace with leaders Chelsea and the rest of the top four, can Mourinho retain his reputation as one of the world’s best coaches, or will his continued insistence that he can do no wrong keep rubbing people up the wrong way?'], ['Obama Birth Certificate Finally Released', 'It has been a long time coming but former president, Barack Hussein Obama’s real birth certificate has finally been released, this time by his own brother, Malik in Kenya. What the original birth certificate reveals is that Obama was born in Kenya and not in Hawaii as the fake document purported. There were many inconsistencies with the fake Hawaii record but the Kenyan one is as real as it gets. This proves that many people who doubted Obama’s right to be president were correct and one way or another, he has been in the middle of a massive forgery and fraud attempt that fooled even the highest echelons of the U.S. hierarchy.'], ['Underestimate Corbyn At Your Own Risk', 'Nothing can be further than the truth. The EU Referendum revealed to many the underbelly of the beast, the Remainers, who support communism, support the abolishment of the royal family and support massive tax hikes on people who have worked hard all their lives to achieve wealth. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, a staunch Marxist Communist Bolshevik is now proposing a yearly tax of 20% to be taken from the assets of the richest. This would solve the deficit according to him, however, as it stands at £1.7 trillion, his little scheme would only raise a paltry £800 million or so. We must not forget that this would only be the beginning, and once first blood is shed, there would have to be more. Communism means that every one is equal in poverty and misery, apart from the party hierarchy, who even have their own lanes on motorways. Under the horrific dystopia of a Corbyn win in the election, Britain would become a communist state, and it would not be long before re-education camps were erected across the countryside, and many would try to flee to better climes only to be detained and interrogated, then summarily stripped of the rest of their wealth. There is a great following for Corbyn, it is all encompassing, as the disenfranchised are many, the jobless, the ones who have no hope, no training, no skills, doomed to a purgatory of poverty, these people have nothing to lose. This is why Corbyn must not be underestimated, as there is a suspicion that he has some form of support from the deep state, he certainly would not have been able to hang on for so long without its help. A Corbyn government would be a great opportunity for political purges, those would be carried out after a short time in power, then the royal family would have their budgets reduced to near zero, a precursor to their eventual demise. We would see bread queues much like happened in the former Soviet USSR, and of course, the party line would be defended by a ruthless politburo and efficient KGB-like secret service. Britain is a nation that views its wealth from home ownership and the increase of house prices, this equity defines many Britons. Under a Corbyn government house prices in Britain would be non existent, as many would fall to state ownership for the poor families. In effect, Corbyn would let the state nationalise your home so it can be used by the unfortunates. Nationalising the majority of housing, rail, transport, farms and manufacturing, would fall into Corbyn’s Collectivist 10-Year-Plan, as once he is elected, there will not be any other elections until he is ousted. How does this all tie in with the EU? Well, as its aspirations to become a Soviet Superstate accelerate, Corbyn would be preparing Britain to completely amalgamate with the EU’s Soviet structure. There are a sizeable amount of EU Remainers in Britain, and their support is assured for Corbyn, from which he will dissolve the British military to be nothing more than a few garrisons, and abolish our nuclear deterrent. This is Corbyn’s key to communistic success, and union with the EU. Communism is alive and well in Britain today, and should not be underestimated.'], ['Wikileaks CIA Hacking Leak Latest', 'Hello Jason Bourne, did you know anything about this? Blackbriar? Treadstone? It’s not as if these Wikileaks revelations are anything new, the CIA is an intricate very focused spy service, that can easily turn off your engine remotely whilst you are travelling at 120 miles per hour on the motorway, they can have one of their assets easily dispatch you in the middle of Euston station, or order one of their drones to put a missile up your ass whilst out in the hills, or languishing in your sitting room watching your smart TV. Vault 7 The ingenuity of the CIA is to read what you wrote before you use that so-called encrypted app, because they have the back door, it was there when your smartphone was made in the factory. This leak from Wikileaks will not weaken the CIA, an outstanding ruthless machine of the state, but will strengthen it as it will have to think about more ingenious ways to listen to people, and if they are suspected of whatever the CIA deems as terrorism or endangering the deep state, they will dispatch these people without even a sniff. As for Julian Assange, ensconced deep within the bowels of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, he is admirable in having the biggest balls this side of river, however if the CIA want to get this guy, they will, one way or another.'], ['Sacked Heseltine Back to Strangling Dogs', 'One would think he would be annoyed at such an action, however according to the peer himself, it has freed up some time for his greatest love — strangling Alsatians. “All these jobs I held in the Lords took up way too much of my time, thus I will shed not one tear at their loss. I will continue strangling dogs to death, as it is my hobby you know. I like to strangle one in the morning, then one or two in the afternoon. On a good day, I can go through five or six, not including puppies,” Heseltine quipped whilst feigning strangulation. If you are wondering what Heseltine does to the dogs once they are strangled to death, it is no surprise that he is a keen taxidermist who sells his creations to other sick fucks who like that sort of thing, and the meat goes to local takeaways for a little extra profit. “My Alsation, Alfie, who I strangled. I still have him up on the book case in the study. Every time I go in there, it’s a reminder of the power of my hands, how his poor eyes bulged as I put the pressure on. Lovely memories.”'], ['Confused Feminist Celebrity Shows Off T*ts', '100 points to Gryffindor “I use my female body and looks to get ahead in the celebrity and acting world. If I was an ugly female, fat and podgy I would not be looked at, so for that I am glad, but I’m still a feminist,” Emma Watson revealed to Vanity Fair magazine. So why has Ms Watson shown off her delightful mammaries in an exclusive titillating photo shoot? “People like tits. I showed mine off because men and some women like to look at my beautiful body and it is aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Feminists don’t realise that the female body when in its prime is a powerful weapon and tool for women to get ahead and has been used for centuries for that very purpose. There is no leading actress today or in the past who has not slept with the right person to get the job. Men are easily controlled by the female body, and we as women have been taking advantage of that fact. It’s all biological. Men are attracted to the pleasing shape of the female body, and this biological attraction is utilised by women to get what they want. As for feminism, as a fickle celebrity, I was enraptured by the Soviet spirit of the Obama presidency and its peddling of feminism, which has sadly passed. Feminism is a soviet communistic construct created primarily by men so that there could be an increase in taxpayers and workers. Without housewives languishing in their homes all day, the work force, and taxpayers doubled over night. This is what feminism really is.” When asked about the efficacy of feminism within society, the celebrity feminist answered in a forthright manner. “Feminism within modern society has created many divergent outcomes. For example, today women are more stressed, they lose their hair earlier, they are getting more breast cancer, they are now dying earlier, and feminists have contributed to the destruction of the traditional family. Socialists and communists who created feminism, do not want functioning families to exist, primarily because it strengthens society and conservative values. and this is a threat to the socialist state. They would much prefer angry women postulating about their feminist virtues and socialistic prowess, as good workers and taxpayers who do not care to have a family yet may still breed future taxpayer bastards by the dozen different males they briefly use as sperm donors, or if you are true feminist, breed only a female through IVF.” Ms. Watson was also asked about feminist values regarding men opening doors for them, as well as politically correct niceties. “Well we all know that political correctness is another term for censorship. By limiting the language allowed to be used by people, it is a form of control, it is also a form of censorship that limits human freedom and is the mainstay of socialism. Men open doors for me all the time, as a feminist, I like the power that I get as a female to have doors opened for me, and feminists may say this is wrong however I think this is the ultimate in feministic control over men. Some feminists do not appreciate a man opening the door for them and will shout down the male in question. These feminists are the angry man-hating ones who can either never get fucked because they are too ugly, or are the horrible ones, users and maladjusted schizoids with serious mental issues. I myself fall under the adored feminist mark, where I use my beauty to get what I want at every turn without exception, yet still am able to read feminist literature and understand it.” The feminist celebrity was asked how many feminist books she had read. “I like to read as many feminist articles and books as possible to indoctrinate my mind with clever pseudo political feminist phrases I can use in conversations to impress the fellow socialists I hang out with, or to put down impertinent males who do not pass the soviet feminist tests we give every day. Feminism, much like Communism, is a religion.” Asked about the difference between feminism and lesbianism, the actress reacted quite abruptly. “Feminism is a form of homosexuality, because it indoctrinates women into the theories of self on self love. Feminism in effect rejects the male patriarchy, it rejects marriage, coupling and it rejects love between the natural male and female. To be on the extreme side of feminism is therefore to reject all males and embrace only females. This is lesbianism in political form, and eventually leads to lesbianism in sexual physical form. Women are natural lesbians, and to enjoy the gentle caress of a woman is implicit to feminism and true sisterhood.”'], ['Corrupt Obama Presidency Like Dog Shit On Shoe That Never Goes Away', 'To many Americans, Obama was always a disgrace to office, but now he could be publicly disgraced and maybe have charges brought upon on him for his illegal activities. Complicit with his cronies in the FBI, NSA and CIA, there are still many factions within these organisations who are under the corrupt wing of Obama, who has taken up a role outside the presidency as some sort of clandestine operative to try and impeach Trump. Obama, always the ultimate control freak, not only heavily controlled and censored the media during his tenure, but still has the likes of CNN, MSNBC, New York Times and Huffington Post under his control. Corruption The corruption, and cronyism within Obama’s government extends outside his presidency, as many have pledged allegiance to his Marxist ideals. Trump, of course, will find all of this very troubling, and his efforts to ban leftist Obama news services from the White House may seem childish at first, but once you come to understand the bias of these so-called ‘impartial’ news services towards the left side of the political spectrum, it is clear that Trump has done the right thing in his own mind, however, one must have balance, and Trump is exhibiting an authoritarian stance in a world that should appreciate both sides of any story. He is in effect falling into the Obama trap, where Obama would heavily punish and censor any news that did not exhibit a left wing socialist homosexual viewpoint. As far as internet conglomerates like Google, Amazon and Facebook, these are all socialist left-wing denizens of Obama, and we have yet to see how they will fare under the auspices of Trump. These internet companies all do not pay much tax, and maybe in the future, things will change unless they embrace a more impartial stance to their political outlook and operations. Obama the dog shit After eight long suffering years under a Marxist president, the United States is going to have to shake off this evil spectre of Obama haunting the corridors with his vile shadow. His corruption goes so deep into the rabbit hole that it disappears into eternal blackness, and Obama has corrupted and infiltrated every corner of the super state he has helped to grow. A super-socialist government of extreme budgetry waste, of spending never before seen by any president in the history of the United States. Of course the stock market went up with Obama, it would if a trillion dollars every few months was released under the auspices of treacherous RINOs like Boehner and Ryan. Obamagate No one is insinuating that there was never corruption before Obama, but let us say that under his nefarious rule, it got to pandemic levels. Obama even went as far as to bug U.N. Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, Merkel, Netanyahu and Sarkozy. If Trump is to shake off the black viscous smelly shadow of Obama, he is going to have to utilise CIA, FBI operatives who are under his rule, not Obama’s, and he is going to have to find and present some real evidence, presented to the people to see for themselves, and once this is done, Obama will be finally disposed of, a taint on the U.S. flag, a distant memory much akin to that time you stepped on a dog shit in the park that one day, you want to forget, the smell, and how it was hard to wipe off the grooves from under your shoe, water, sticks, rubbing on grass, it took ages but still the smell lingered. Obama is that dog shit on a shoe. The smell of Obama just does not want to go away.'], ['House of Lords to be Made into Art Gallery', '“We already have a nice wide space and although the lighting needs a little work, we can achieve a wonderful gallery for the works of art to languish and the public to enjoy,” senior curator, Miles Spencer told the BBC. The second largest unelected political group next to China, the House of Lords costs taxpayers £100 million per year and frankly does not contribute anything to the country. “The House of Lords is basically a parasitical group of freeloaders who do not do anything good for the nation, and these parasites only take, they are paid so much money for not doing anything that they are completely useless unelected arseholes,” one parliament insider revealed. Although the art gallery installation will be free for the public to attend, there will be a restaurant and cafe as well as shop for revenue. “No one will miss the Lords, and a functioning gallery will be a true service to the public and Westminster as a whole. We have already produced a White paper on the proposal and the final decision will be implemented without the consent of the Lords, who will have no say on anything from now on. As a member of the Commons, I can’t wait to come and see some great works of art after parliamentary sessions in what used to be the House of Lords, maybe some Monet, Picasso, or Rembrandt, as opposed to some dour unelected meddling overpaid useless prat called a Lord,” an elected member of the House of Commons added.'], ['Make It Virtual: What Online Casinos Have that Land-based Casinos Don’t', 'Back in the mid-1990s, a British company called Microgaming started the whole thing by mixing casino games with secure online payments. The company’s owners were smart – they left the whole “promotion and competition” thing to their customers, providing them with the software to run on their websites instead. In the last two decades, the number of no deposit casinos UK players can play at has grown exponentially, providing them with an amazing variety of games to play, along with a nice and entertaining way to kill time. If you are a frequent visitor at the Genting or a lifetime member at The Aspers, you might not feel the need to try playing online. Yet there are quite a few reasons why you might consider at least giving it a try. Muhammad and the mountain “If the mountain won’t come to Muhammad then Muhammad must go to the mountain”, Francis Bacon wrote in his Essays, probably based on a Turkish saying (but it sounds much better if we quote a famous English philosopher than an unknown Turkish imam). The same was the case with casinos in the past: if the games didn’t come to you, you were the one who had to go to them. This was all fine, of course, until the internet came along, turning many of us into lazy couch potatoes that won’t lift a finger if not forced to. Thanks to Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s work, the mountain can finally come to Muhammad – and casinos can finally come to us. A comfortable environment No matter where you are, you’ll never feel as relaxed and free than at home. Casinos have environments carefully crafted to make you feel like playing just another round but no matter what they do, they won’t be as comfy as your favourite armchair in your own (or your rented) living room. With online casinos, you have everything covered: you can sit back as comfortably as you want, with your own fridge and your own toilet just a few steps away, and play your favourite games on a laptop or a smartphone. What’s even better: you can take them with you to the fridge and to the toilet if you want to – something that would attract a few disapprobatory glances if you attempted in a land-based casino. No need to dress up There’s one thing at land-based casinos that online casinos will never have: a dress code. For as long as they are concerned, you can play in your undergarments, wear your most dishevelled hairdo, and no makeup at all. You can play naked for all they care – another thing that would be quite conspicuous and frowned upon at a land-based casino.'], ['Oscars Doo Doo Land Wins', ' Hollywood is now officially dead, although it died a long time ago, it really is a corpse full of preening maggots undulating amongst the rotting flesh of poor scripts, mediocre actors and the tendency to bypass plots and rely on CGI.

How many times do you want to see a penguin jumping up on an iceberg talking in a Brooklyn accent? Fuck that, and fuck Hollywood, let us hope it falls into the sea never to be seen again.

Cinema bookings are practically zero now, what with streaming you can see any film you ever heard of on the internet for free in HD. Many people have renounced cinemas purely on the precept that giving a single dime to the studios is a serious crime. Why in the world would you want to do that? Why support bullshit? There is no plot no script no cinematography even worth waving your dick at any more let alone paying for. Today’s studio bosses should be ashamed of themselves, how they have run their own industry into the ground, you are all to blame, and this is why people do not want to go to cinemas any more.

There is a concerted effort not only in the High Street to punish the populace over the Brexit decision but now the business rates rise is falling on many business owners threatening to shut them down permanently. Javid and dog strangler Heseltine are two names that come to mind when engineering the business rates fiasco. The two pronged attack is being orchestrated by Remainers in the Cabinet and corporate manufacturers who are taking their orders from Brussels. One always suspects Theresa May, who has nonchalantly stood by for months whilst plotters regrouped and made further plans to thwart Brexit, she herself was a key Remainer, and still receives consultation from chief Remainers within the Conservative and Labour party.

Enough is enough, if one pulls the rubber band too far it eventually snaps, and so shall the people. There will be no end to the disenchantment from the majority of the British population, if it takes a hundred years of riots, if it takes ten thousand referendums, we will never change our minds about the toxic EU. One thing that has become apparent since the EU referendum is the amount of traitors that lie within this Isle. Those who would sell their country for a pittance, and those that collaborate with Britain’s enemies without flinching. This country has now many enemies within, and Remainers, if they were around in 1941, and we had lost the Battle of Britain would have welcomed the Nazis with open arms. Remainers are lickspittle treacherous quisling scum who deserve no mercy. There will be no respite to the war coming, for this will be one so vicious and nasty that it will be noted in historical reference books for children to read in the schools of the future.

The discussion ends as soon as the copycatters come onto the scene making any conversation null and void. The same goes for YouTube videos. There is nothing of value on YouTube today apart from a few instructional functional videos. The conversation is lost amongst a maelstrom of meaningless banal pap, spammers and copycats pathetically begging for subscribers and likes. The Internet may have been the greatest invention by humans ever created, however it has also been humanity’s worst enemy, because it has trivialised meaning in everything. Car crashes come a dime a dozen, women come a dime a dozen, friends come by the million, and your opinion does not count any more.

We are in that future now, where people have been dumbed down by decades of socialist propaganda, and conditioning, they not only do not know who they are any more but can be told pretty much anything without them questioning.

Instead, the dollar is going to back the Greeks with some soft loans and a comprehensive rescue deal leaving the euro floundering in the muck. The news is that Trump is willing to back the Greeks with the dollar until they get their shit ready for a change back to drachma. In a country where 50% of households do not pay income tax even Trump may balk at the severity of the problem. How many cans have been kicked down the road since the beginning of the Greek crisis, this time however, things are different because the Don is coming to rescue the Greeks from the evil EU, an entity so hated that even leprosy would be preferred than being part of something so insidious. Leaving the euro in such a manner will effectively castrate the EU, and of course be a mighty FU, for all times sake.

Broken and in pain, Hemingway decided to end his own life but his legacy will live forever. Today, let’s take a look at the part of his life that’s perhaps less known: Ernest Hemingway: the writer and the gambler. Would he have lived today, Hemingway would have probably hated online gambling. He was a man used to a hands-on approach – playing remotely at the Vegas Palms, or betting on horses miles away. Playing at the Vegas Palms is a perfect fit for our connected society where everyone walks around with small computers in their pockets. But in his time, the artist would have probably preferred to place the bets with his own hand, and pocket his winnings in cash, not through an e-wallet or a credit card. A passion for the races Sports were among Hemingway’s passions throughout his life. He himself took part in a number of them – boxing was a life-long pursuit for him, but he tried water polo, track and field, and football. He was, in turn, interested in other sports and activities – during his years in Europe, he developed an interest in bullfighting, which made him return to Pamplona several times, and cycling, which he gave evidence of in his book “The Sun Also Rises”. He was also passionate about horse racing, and he was a punter, too. In “A Movable Feast”, he writes about his passion for horse racing: “We went racing together more times that year and other years after I had worked in early mornings, and Hadley enjoyed it and sometimes she loved it. […] It was not really racing either. It was gambling on horses. But we called it racing.” A passion for poker Hemingway’s passion for poker is not something mentioned on his Wikipedia biography. But he was a good player ever since his early years – he and his friends used to play secret games in their hometown, where poker was considered a sin. Anecdotes mention his secret poker games in Austria, at the hotel he stayed. Secret since poker was illegal in the country at the time. Later in his life, he was often joined at the poker table by big names like director John Huston, actor John Wayne and renowned photographer Robert Capa. He is said to have played poker the way he lived his life: “Never call; either raise or put it down.”'], ['Article 50: House of Lords or Labour Appointed Euro-Peers on EU Pensions?', 'Corruptio optimi pessima The House of Lords is currently full of an unelected syphilitic crew of socialist peers who either bought their seats or were instated by the previous Labour government, to this end, there is great uncertainty whether the Article 50 White paper will pass scrutiny from these treacherous traitors lining the seats of the Lords, these slithering snakes in a stinking snake pit of inequity. The corruption of the Lords is well defined, one can buy a seat quite easily by making the correct donation amount to the party that is in power, and this is why in no uncertain terms the House of Lords as it stands today is unfit for purpose. As these corrupt individuals take their places every day, they receive £400 just to turn up, not including their massive expense accounts and pensions. We have the Dark Lord Mandelson hissing in corridors, a bleak leftie figure who plots with great malice on those in the way of the EU. He receives his large stipend from Brussels every month, and delights on spending the money on pink satin sheets and Italian marble floors so he can play with his young boy concubines in one of his many mansions. Then we have the coal miner fraternity, deep deep Marxists like Lord Arthur Scargill, a denizen of the communist EU, who receives a large pension from Brussels every month amounting to £86,000 per annum. Scargill proclaimed the EU referendum result as: “won by falsehood”. Lord Patten is another one who receives large payments from Brussels, and labelled the Brexit vote as ‘xenophobic’. As we have thus illustrated, this is only a small picture of what is ahead. The halls of the House of Lords are thick with these parasites, these paid-off buffoons and corrupt scum bags of the lowest order. There is most certainly no love for the people here, or respect for their wishes to leave the EU, in fact there is only derision and malice for the general population. The majority in the Lords only care for their money, and the prospect of making more money, they do not care one iota for anything else. Our verdict: If it was up to the Squib we would abolish the House of Lords tomorrow as it serves no purpose apart from entertaining corrupt officials and their agendas, but it is a mainstay of British politics and still survives, alas, since hereditary peers were more or less abolished it has fallen from grace to the point of no return. If the Lords do not acknowledge the will of the people, and of the House of Commons, needless to say, there may very well be a push to abolish the Lords once and for all.

But, particularly for novice players, they should pay just as much attention to the things that they should avoid doing. Because bad habits soon become engrained behaviour which it becomes ever more tricky to drop – and that certainly won’t win you money, it’s much more likely to lose it. So here are some tips about real no-no’s for the most common games, whether you’re playing in a real one or enjoying an online live casino experience. But, before we get into them, the over-riding principle for all casino games, is to make sure that you know all of the rules before you start. If you don’t, then you’ll already be at a big disadvantage. Blackjack Blackjack’s also a simple game but has pitfalls along the way. These include not knowing when to split a hand or when you should stick on a hand. Luckily a great deal of this has already been worked out mathematically for you and incorporated into the basic blackjack strategy – all you have to do is memorise it. Finally, something to definitely avoid is taking insurance on a hand. In the long run it’s going to eat into your winnings – plus it takes away some of the thrill of playing. Roulette There are two kinds of roulette generally played in most casinos – American and European. Never play the American version if you have the choice. That’s because it features both “0” and “00” on the wheel as well as the 36 numbers. This increases the odds in the house’s favour and, while the difference may be marginal, it’s still making it less likely that you’ll win. You’ll also find there’s a great deal of information about supposedly fool proof roulette systems and you should treat these claims with real caution. One of the most well-known is the martingale in which you double your stake after each losing bet. But if you have even a moderate run of bad luck you’ll soon get through your stake money. Far better to rely on a slow and steady approach placing evens bets. There won’t be any dramatic big wins but there’s a good chance that you’ll steadily accumulate cash. Craps Craps isn’t complicated, but the betting can be and there are some kinds of wager that carry a far higher house edge than others including the Horn Bet and the Any 7. So it’s far better to stick with ones like the pass line and don’t pass line where the odds are more stacked in your favour. It can also be tempting to place multiple bets in a game. If things go right for you then this works out well, but if they don’t then you’ll soon run out of cash. Far better to place single bets and play longer. You should also think about placing odds bets when you can because these will pay evens money and reduce the house edge.'], ['Tara Palmer-Tomkinson Refused Entry into First Class Lounge in Heaven', ' Her ‘it-girl’ status was her own undoing, here was this privileged person snorting £400 worth of cocaine up her nostrils daily, indulging in crack and meth, until her septum nasi disappeared, seared by years of ravage to the white stuff. Tara Palmer-Tomkinson fucked like a rabbit and had an insatiable nymphomaniac appetite for debauchery, for this alone she should be inducted into the halls of the ever grinding loins, for it is to the service of Bacchus that she will be remembered. Obviously Royal connections open doors, and many were opened for this hip gyrating mistress of carnal purgatory, as her chaotic membrane befuddled and torn skimmed through the societal walls much like excrement is pumped through bubbling sewer pipes furnished with well-paid ghost writers. Hell o The higher echelons of English society can be as cruel as the lower, and here was this wild eyed maiden on cocaine looking for approval but would never find it. Such is the standoffish harsh nature of the English aristocratic class that parental affection is rarely shown to children leaving them in perpetual limbo for the rest of their sorry loveless lives. Tara was a lost child only looking for some kind of love which she never was to find, looked down upon by the higher ranks as an eccentric curiosity and laughed at by the grimy lower half. Society should embrace the eccentrics but sadly these days they are scorned more than anything else. The spirit of Dionysian plenty can only follow this misunderstood creature to the depths of depravity and absolution. And up upon yonder, Tara whooshes into the eternal universal maelstrom, perhaps to be denied entry into the VIP lounge will be the final insult for this tempestuous everlasting misfit.'], ['Why Boycotting BBC Licence is Only Way to Induce Change', ' If you do not pay the TV licence tax from the age of 18 – 75 you will save £8,000. That saving in itself should be impetus enough to never pay the nefarious BBC taxation. Many of us grew up with the BBC, however the corporation has changed for the worse in recent years, it now has a very noticeable bias towards the EU, possibly because it receives millions of pounds each year to continue broadcasting pro-EU propaganda. Also, the quality of the programming has deteriorated to such a level that much of it is unwatchable pap. The only redeeming factor for the BBC recently was the Taboo drama series starring Tom Hardy, but that’s about it. One can easily watch the odd good BBC program on an internet streaming site where the servers are located somewhere in China. The internet is now full of websites streaming the latest Hollywood films and series all served up from China where there is no such thing as copyright. British ISPs have been ordered to block these sites, however if one is blocked they either change the url or another ten servers pop up in their place. What does this say about copyright and the rights of the producers of the material being streamed on the internet? Sadly, it’s a losing battle because in some parts of the globe there is absolutely no respect for copyright resulting in a loss of revenue for film companies and the industry as a whole. Unless China stops what it is doing, nothing will change. The plus side for all these shenanigans is that you don’t have to pay £17.80 every time you want to watch the latest film release in the cinema. Just log on to the internets and watch it for free, most of the latest Hollywood offerings of late have been so awful, that when you fast forward the film you will take great pleasure that you saved yourself the cost of going to some overpriced cinema and wasted your well earned money on utter shite. The same goes for the BBC, by not having a licence you have actually not missed much. There is no point in paying for something as substandard as the BBC is at the moment and the severe left-wing bias that is blatantly shown every day. Watching an episode of the Grand Tour on Amazon is proof of that very point, where the BBC has failed miserably, Clarkson and those erudite chaps he hangs around with are making a killing elsewhere, leaving the BBC in a total mess, a turgid morose void of blackness has filled the BBC space, and it is getting worse every day, every year. We need millions more people to join us in this peaceful resistance to a nefarious taxation on the TV. The more of us that hold out, the less funding the BBC will receive. That point alone is a point of victory, so spread the word, the more the better. We must be almost evangelical in our movement to destroy the BBC TV tax that is unjust harassment, corrupt and ultimately criminal in its enactment. Tips for avoiding the BBC TV Licence Tax As soon as you stop paying the TV licence your address will be marked. The BBC will send threatening harassing letters to you every week. Simply put these in the recycle bin without opening the envelope. The BBC or Capita have no power to do anything to you with their empty threats in their letters. Never answer the door to a TV inspector, and if you do, never say anything or answer their questions. If you must say something, tell them you remove the Implied Right Of Access to your property. TV inspectors have no powers of arrest or any other power to enter your property. Film them and put them on YouTube. Best policy is to be TV free, however if you need a big screen for DVDs or games, that’s okay. It is also all right to watch Netflix or other streaming services on your TV.'], ['Profligate Greeks the Poison Ordered Up by EU Idiots Too Blind to See', "Most Greeks are unaware of any hardship and are living the good life on the EU's dime The EU already had warning about the profligate Greeks, a country of 11 million people who managed to squander 650 Billion Euros in less than five years. Where that money went is a mystery, but the EU is so entrenched in its failing project that even after the Greek spending spree they kept throwing billions of euros into the Greek black hole as it teetered on the edge of complete bankruptcy. The Euroexecutives on their unlimited expense accounts are too fearful of rocking the boat, and if the problem of Greece had been dealt with in 2012, and the battered can not kicked down the road further, it wouldn’t rear its ugly head again and again, much like a Gorgon that refuses to die. The most potent poison for the EU was always Greece, because it eats away resources that could be utilised better elsewhere. Trying to get the Greeks to not retire at 45 on a full salary pension is a task too great even for the IMF. In 2012, the Squib wrote about the demise of the EU, and we prayed they would not throw out Greece, our prayers were answered as the EU scrambled to do anything to keep the most sclerotic country in the union. Even though in 2013 Greek debt was 175.1% of GDP, the EU kept pumping the 4 hour working day Greeks with so much cash they just didn’t know what to do with it but spend, spend, spend. There is proof now that Greece is an eternal debt megafuck of ginormous proportions and the socialist structure of the country will always bleed large sums of money, coupled with corrupt ministers and businesses, there is no hope for Greece apart from maybe an implosion, exit from EU and a return to the drachma. We don’t want that though, we want Juncker to fawn over Tsipras or which ever useless leader they have. We want the EU to do everything it can possibly do to keep the Greek thorn in its side. To bleed the EU constantly until there is nothing left but a corpse, suppurating in the corner. If Greece leaves, the EU will have a chance of survival, this should never happen, may the corrupt profligate lazy parasitical Greeks smash the EU once and for all, saving Europe from the calamity of a German led Soviet bloc that is becoming increasingly authoritarian and is in effect a totalitarian collectivist Soviet construct."], ['The Neutrality of House Speaker Bercow and Other Things', ' Let us read from the official website www.parliament.uk where it states quite clearly: Politically impartial Speakers must be politically impartial. Therefore, on election the new Speaker must resign from their political party and remain separate from political issues even in retirement. However, the Speaker will deal with their constituents’ problems like a normal MP. And from here, let us go to the current House Speaker, John Bercow’s little tirade against the newly elected president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. “Before the imposition of the migrant ban I would myself have been strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall,” Mr Bercow told MPs. “After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall.” Parliamentary insiders have revealed some wonderful news, that this impartial imposition on Britain’s greatest ally could mean the end of Bercow as House Speaker. Rumours have it that his extreme left wing whore wife is the author of this mess, and has pushed her ‘impartial’ husband to deny Trump his day in parliament. If this is the case, the House Speaker has crossed a line from which he cannot recover. Bercow, has of course many enemies in the Commons, particularly within the Tories, and they are now waiting for the moment to stick their daggers into Bercow’s back and finish him once and for all.'], ['The Insincerity of David Beckham’s Charity Masquerade', ' Whilst pretending to care about talking to African kids on a football pitch in the Sudan, or whatever other place the photoshoot was set up, Beckham only had one thing on his mind — a Knighthood from the Queen. This despicable poseur and illiterate boy-voiced babbler from Chingford is a prime example of what is wrong with celebrity culture, an insipid pit of detritus that sometimes reveals everything it is made up of to the public. Yes, sure, hackers are not the cream of the crop too, but in this case they have come on top. By revealing Beckham to be what he really is, light has finally broken through the darkness of secrecy and lies portrayed by egotistical rats like Beckham, a shameful disgrace to humanity and ‘charity’. In one message the 41-year-old former England captain branded the Honours Committee “unappreciative cunts” after missing out on a knighthood in 2013 and dismissed lesser awards, ranting: “Unless it’s a knighthood fuck off”. David Beckham, you are a despicable, useless excuse for a human being and you do not deserve even one crumb of mercy for your lies. Let us hope this is remembered to your last days and you are struck off from UNICEF.'], ['Why Christians Should Be Banned From Entering the U.S.', 'A man is tortured by fire while Christian priests watch during the Spanish Inquisition 1478 Throughout history, Christians have created more death and mayhem than any other recorded religion in the history of mankind. From Hitler’s Christian troops who believed they were upholding god’s word by killing Jews, to the Japan atomic bomb detonations to the Spanish Inquisition and to the missionaries in South America who committed atrocities on the indigenous population in the name of Jesus, there is enough evidence out there proving how evil Christianity is. Lest we forget the smiling Catholic priests of Europe who in world war II eagerly revealed where the Jews were and waved them away as they were ferried to the concentration camps to die. To have something masked in goodness and love, yet to commit unspeakable acts of cruelty on people describes the Christian faith very succinctly. This malevolent religion masks itself in outward displays of goodness, charity and love yet behind doors priests commit unspeakable evil acts of buggery on children in the name of Jesus Christ. The Holy Christian church is an evil organisation, almost demonic in its acts of cruelty to children with the proliferation of paedophile priests fucking little boys in the vestry whilst only a few feet away someone innocently utters the lord’s prayer. Christianity should most definitely be banned from any nation, as the atrocities created in its name are too long to even list. George W. Bush himself an evangelical Christian, along with Tony Blair a devout Catholic know all too well of what they did in Iraq in the name of Jesus Christ. They murdered and butchered over 1.6 million Muslims and displaced millions more from their homeland. All in the name of their god of course, and who is to say they were not justified in their actions, especially when they had the full support of the churches during the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. The demonic entity of the Catholic church itself, the Holy See is one of the richest most affluent organisations in the world. How they have amassed such large amounts of money is of course a trick of the devil himself, for he masks his technique well whilst plundering and enriching in the name of of Jesus Christ. Here is a small list of Christian atrocities committed throughout history. By all means cross reference the list yourself, do your own research: Deaths Caused by Christianity Ancient Pagans As soon as Christianity was legal (315), more and more pagan temples were destroyed by Christian mobs. Pagan priests were killed in their thousands. Between 315 and 6th century thousands of pagan believers were slain. Examples of destroyed Temples: the Sanctuary of Aesculap in Aegaea, the Temple of Aphrodite in Golgatha, Aphaka in Lebanon, the Heliopolis. Christian priests such as Mark of Arethusa or Cyrill of Heliopolis were famous as “temple destroyers.” [DA468] Pagan services became punishable by death in 356. [DA468] Christian Emperor Theodosius (408-450) even had children executed, because they had been playing with remains of pagan statues. [DA469] According to Christian chroniclers he “followed meticulously all Christian teachings…” In 6th century pagans were declared void of all rights. In the early fourth century the philosopher Sopatros was executed on demand of Christian authorities. [DA466] The world famous female philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria was torn to pieces with glass fragments by a hysterical Christian mob led by a Christian minister named Peter, in a church, in 415. [DO19-25] Mission Emperor Karl (Charlemagne) in 782 had 4500 Saxons, unwilling to convert to Christianity, beheaded. [DO30] Peasants of Steding (Germany) unwilling to pay suffocating church taxes: between 5,000 and 11,000 men, women and children slain 5/27/1234 near Altenesch/Germany. [WW223] Battle of Belgrad 1456: 80,000 Turks slaughtered. [DO235] 15th century Poland: 1019 churches and 17987 villages plundered by Knights of the Order. Victims unknown. [DO30] 16th and 17th century Ireland. English troops “pacified and civilized” Ireland, where only Gaelic “wild Irish”, “unreasonable beasts lived without any knowledge of God or good manners, in common of their goods, cattle, women, children and every other thing.” One of the more successful soldiers, a certain Humphrey Gilbert, half-brother of Sir Walter Raleigh, ordered that “the heddes of all those (of what sort soever thei were) which were killed in the daie, should be cutte off from their bodies… and should bee laied on the ground by eche side of the waie”, which effort to civilize the Irish indeed caused “greate terrour to the people when thei sawe the heddes of their dedde fathers, brothers, children, kinsfolke, and freinds on the grounde”.Tens of thousands of Gaelic Irish fell victim to the carnage. [SH99, 225] Crusades (1095-1291) First Crusade: 1095 on command of pope Urban II. [WW11-41] Semlin/Hungary 6/24/96 thousands slain. Wieselburg/Hungary 6/12/96 thousands. [WW23] 9/9/96-9/26/96 Nikaia, Xerigordon (then Turkish), thousands respectively. [WW25-27] Until Jan 1098 a total of 40 capital cities and 200 castles conquered (number of slain unknown) [WW30] after 6/3/98 Antiochia (then Turkish) conquered, between 10,000 and 60,000 slain. 6/28/98 100,000 Turks (incl. women & children) killed. [WW32-35] Here the Christians “did no other harm to the women found in [the enemy’s] tents—save that they ran their lances through their bellies,” according to Christian chronicler Fulcher of Chartres. [EC60] Marra (Maraat an-numan) 12/11/98 thousands killed. Because of the subsequent famine “the already stinking corpses of the enemies were eaten by the Christians” said chronicler Albert Aquensis. [WW36] Jerusalem conquered 7/15/1099 more than 60,000 victims (Jewish, Muslim, men, women, children). [WW37-40] (In the words of one witness: “there [in front of Solomon’s temple] was such a carnage that our people were wading ankle-deep in the blood of our foes”, and after that “happily and crying for joy our people marched to our Saviour’s tomb, to honour it and to pay off our debt of gratitude”) The Archbishop of Tyre, eye-witness, wrote: “It was impossible to look upon the vast numbers of the slain without horror; everywhere lay fragments of human bodies, and the very ground was covered with the blood of the slain. It was not alone the spectacle of headless bodies and mutilated limbs strewn in all directions that roused the horror of all who looked upon them. Still more dreadful was it to gaze upon the victors themselves, dripping with blood from head to foot, an ominous sight which brought terror to all who met them. It is reported that within the Temple enclosure alone about ten thousand infidels perished.” [TG79] Christian chronicler Eckehard of Aura noted that “even the following summer in all of Palestine the air was polluted by the stench of decomposition”. One million victims of the first crusade alone. [WW41] Battle of Askalon, 8/12/1099. 200,000 heathens slaughtered “in the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ”. [WW45] Fourth crusade: 4/12/1204 Constantinople sacked, number of victims unknown, numerous thousands, many of them Christian. [WW141-148] Rest of Crusades in less detail: until the fall of Akkon 1291 probably 20 million victims (in the Holy land and Arab/Turkish areas alone). [WW224] Note: All figures according to contemporary (Christian) chroniclers. Heretics Already in 385 C.E. the first Christians, the Spanish Priscillianus and six followers, were beheaded for heresy in Trier/Germany [DO26] Manichaean heresy: a crypto-Christian sect decent enough to practice birth control (and thus not as irresponsible as faithful Catholics) was exterminated in huge campaigns all over the Roman empire between 372 C.E. and 444 C.E. Numerous thousands of victims. [NC] Albigensians: the first Crusade intended to slay other Christians. [DO29] The Albigensians…viewed themselves as good Christians, but would not accept Roman Catholic rule, and taxes, and prohibition of birth control. [NC] Begin of violence: on command of pope Innocent III (greatest single pre-Nazi mass murderer) in 1209. Bezirs (today France) 7/22/1209 destroyed, all the inhabitants were slaughtered. Victims (including Catholics refusing to turn over their heretic neighbours and friends) 20,000-70,000. [WW179-181] Carcassonne 8/15/1209, thousands slain. Other cities followed. [WW181] Subsequent 20 years of war until nearly all Cathars (probably half the population of the Languedoc, today southern France) were exterminated. [WW183] After the war ended (1229) the Inquisition was founded 1232 to search and destroy surviving/hiding heretics. Last Cathars burned at the stake 1324. [WW183] Estimated one million victims (Cathar heresy alone), [WW183] Other heresies: Waldensians, Paulikians, Runcarians, Josephites, and many others. Most of these sects exterminated, (Some Waldensians live today, yet they had to endure 600 years of persecution) Estimated at hundred thousand victims (including the Spanish inquisition but excluding victims in the New World). Spanish Inquisitor Torquemada alone allegedly responsible for 10,220 burnings. [DO28] John Huss, a critic of papal infallibility and indulgences, was burned at the stake in 1415. [LI475-522] University professor B. Hubmaier burned at the stake 1538 in Vienna. [DO59] Giordano Bruno, Dominican monk, after having been incarcerated for seven years, was burned at the stake for heresy on the Campo dei Fiori (Rome) on 2/17/1600. Witches From the beginning of Christianity to 1484 probably more than several thousand. In the era of witch hunting (1484-1750) according to modern scholars several hundred thousand (about 80% female) burned at the stake or hanged. [WV] Incomplete list of documented cases: The Burning of Witches – A Chronicle of the Burning Times Religious Wars 15th century: Crusades against Hussites, thousands slain. [DO30] 1538 pope Paul III declared Crusade against apostate England and all English as slaves of Church (fortunately had not power to go into action). [DO31] 1568 Spanish Inquisition Tribunal ordered extermination of 3 million rebels in (then Spanish) Netherlands. Thousands were actually slain. [DO31] 1572 In France about 20,000 Huguenots were killed on command of pope Pius V. Until 17th century 200,000 flee. [DO31] 17th century: Catholics slay Gaspard de Coligny, a Protestant leader. After murdering him, the Catholic mob mutilated his body, “cutting off his head, his hands, and his genitals… and then dumped him into the river […but] then, deciding that it was not worthy of being food for the fish, they hauled it out again [… and] dragged what was left … to the gallows of Montfaulcon, ‘to be meat and carrion for maggots and crows’.” [SH191] 17th century: Catholics sack the city of Magdeburg/Germany: roughly 30,000 Protestants were slain. “In a single church fifty women were found beheaded,” reported poet Friedrich Schiller, “and infants still sucking the breasts of their lifeless mothers.” [SH191] 17th century 30 years’ war (Catholic vs. Protestant): at least 40% of population decimated, mostly in Germany. [DO31-32] Jews Already in the 4th and 5th centuries synagogues were burned by Christians. Number of Jews slain unknown. In the middle of the fourth century the first synagogue was destroyed on command of bishop Innocentius of Dertona in Northern Italy. The first synagogue known to have been burned down was near the river Euphrat, on command of the bishop of Kallinikon in the year 388. [DA450] Council of Toledo 694: Jews were enslaved, their property confiscated, and their children forcibly baptised. [DA454] The Bishop of Limoges (France) in 1010 had the cities’ Jews, who would not convert to Christianity, expelled or killed. [DA453] First Crusade: Thousands of Jews slaughtered 1096, maybe 12.000 total. Places: Worms 5/18/1096, Mainz 5/27/1096 (1100 persons), Cologne, Neuss, Altenahr, Wevelinghoven, Xanten, Moers, Dortmund, Kerpen, Trier, Metz, Regensburg, Prag and others (All locations Germany except Metz/France, Prag/Czech) [EJ] Second Crusade: 1147. Several hundred Jews were slain in Ham, Sully, Carentan, and Rameru (all locations in France). [WW57] Third Crusade: English Jewish communities sacked 1189/90. [DO40] Fulda/Germany 1235: 34 Jewish men and women slain. [DO41] 1257, 1267: Jewish communities of London, Canterbury, Northampton, Lincoln, Cambridge, and others exterminated. [DO41] 1290 in Bohemian (Poland) allegedly 10,000 Jews killed. [DO41] 1337 Starting in Deggendorf/Germany a Jew-killing craze reaches 51 towns in Bavaria, Austria, Poland. [DO41] 1348 All Jews of Basel/Switzerland and Strasbourg/France (two thousand) burned. [DO41] 1349 In more than 350 towns in Germany all Jews murdered, mostly burned alive (in this one year more Jews were killed than Christians in 200 years of ancient Roman persecution of Christians). [DO42] 1389 In Prag 3,000 Jews were slaughtered. [DO42] 1391 Seville’s Jews killed (Archbishop Martinez leading). 4,000 were slain, 25,000 sold as slaves. [DA454] Their identification was made easy by the brightly colored “badges of shame” that all jews above the age of ten had been forced to wear. 1492: In the year Columbus set sail to conquer a New World, more than 150,000 Jews were expelled from Spain, many died on their way: 6/30/1492. [MM470-476] 1648 Chmielnitzki massacres: In Poland about 200,000 Jews were slain. [DO43] 1941 – 1943: Six million Jews killed by Hitler in concentration camps in the name of Christian Aryan purity. Native Peoples Beginning with Columbus (a former slave trader and would-be Holy Crusader) the conquest of the New World began, as usual understood as a means to propagate Christianity. Within hours of landfall on the first inhabited island he encountered in the Caribbean, Columbus seized and carried off six native people who, he said, “ought to be good servants … [and] would easily be made Christians, because it seemed to me that they belonged to no religion.” [SH200] While Columbus described the Indians as “idolators” and “slaves, as many as [the Crown] shall order,” his pal Michele de Cuneo, Italian nobleman, referred to the natives as “beasts” because “they eat when they are hungry,” and made love “openly whenever they feel like it.” [SH204-205] On every island he set foot on, Columbus planted a cross, “making the declarations that are required” – the requerimiento – to claim the ownership for his Catholic patrons in Spain. And “nobody objected.” If the Indians refused or delayed their acceptance (or understanding), the requerimiento continued: I CERTIFY TO YOU THAT, WITH THE HELP OF GOD, WE SHALL POWERFULLY ENTER IN YOUR COUNTRY AND SHALL MAKE WAR AGAINST YOU … AND SHALL SUBJECT YOU TO THE YOKE AND OBEDIENCE OF THE CHURCH … AND SHALL DO YOU ALL MISCHIEF THAT WE CAN, AS TO VASSALS WHO DO NOT OBEY AND REFUSE TO RECEIVE THEIR LORD AND RESIST AND CONTRADICT HIM.” [SH66] Likewise in the words of John Winthrop, first governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony: “justifieinge the undertakeres of the intended Plantation in New England … to carry the Gospell into those parts of the world, … and to raise a Bulworke against the kingdome of the Ante-Christ.” [SH235] In average two thirds of the native population were killed by colonist-imported smallpox before violence began. This was a great sign of “the marvelous goodness and providence of God” to the Christians of course, e.g. the Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony wrote in 1634, as “for the natives, they are near all dead of the smallpox, so as the Lord hath cleared our title to what we possess.” [SH109,238] On Hispaniola alone, on Columbus visits, the native population (Arawak), a rather harmless and happy people living on an island of abundant natural resources, a literal paradise, soon mourned 50,000 dead. [SH204] The surviving Indians fell victim to rape, murder, enslavement and Spanish raids. As one of the culprits wrote: “So many Indians died that they could not be counted, all through the land the Indians lay dead everywhere. The stench was very great and pestiferous.” [SH69] The Indian chief Hatuey fled with his people but was captured and burned alive. As “they were tying him to the stake a Franciscan friar urged him to take Jesus to his heart so that his soul might go to heaven, rather than descend into hell. Hatuey replied that if heaven was where the Christians went, he would rather go to hell.” [SH70] What happened to his people was described by an eyewitness: “The Spaniards found pleasure in inventing all kinds of odd cruelties … They built a long gibbet, long enough for the toes to touch the ground to prevent strangling, and hanged thirteen [natives] at a time in honour of Christ Our Saviour and the twelve Apostles… then, straw was wrapped around their torn bodies and they were burned alive.” [SH72] Or, on another occasion: “The Spaniards cut off the arm of one, the leg or hip of another, and from some their heads at one stroke, like butchers cutting up beef and mutton for market. Six hundred, including the Cacique, were thus slain like brute beasts…Vasco [de Balboa] ordered forty of them to be torn to pieces by dogs.” [SH83] The “island’s population of about eight million people at the time of Columbus’s arrival in 1492 already had declined by a third to a half before the year 1496 was out.” Eventually all the island’s natives were exterminated, so the Spaniards were “forced” to import slaves from other Caribbean islands, who soon suffered the same fate. Thus “the Caribbean’s millions of native people [were] thereby effectively liquidated in barely a quarter of a century”. [SH72-73] “In less than the normal lifetime of a single human being, an entire culture of millions of people, thousands of years resident in their homeland, had been exterminated.” [SH75] “And then the Spanish turned their attention to the mainland of Mexico and Central America. The slaughter had barely begun. The exquisite city of Tenochtitln [Mexico city] was next.” [SH75] Cortez, Pizarro, De Soto and hundreds of other Spanish conquistadors likewise sacked southern and Mesoamerican civilizations in the name of Christ (De Soto also sacked Florida). “When the 16th century ended, some 200,000 Spaniards had moved to the Americas. By that time probably more than 60,000,000 natives were dead.” [SH95] Of course no different were the founders of what today is the US of A. Although none of the settlers would have survived winter without native help, they soon set out to expel and exterminate the Indians. Warfare among (north American) Indians was rather harmless, in comparison to European standards, and was meant to avenge insults rather than conquer land. In the words of some of the pilgrim fathers: “Their Warres are farre less bloudy…”, so that there usually was “no great slawter of nether side”. Indeed, “they might fight seven yeares and not kill seven men.” What is more, the Indians usually spared women and children. [SH111] In the spring of 1612 some English colonists found life among the (generally friendly and generous) natives attractive enough to leave Jamestown – “being idell … did runne away unto the Indyans,” – to live among them. “Governor Thomas Dale had them hunted down and executed: ‘Some he apointed (sic) to be hanged Some burned Some to be broken upon wheles, others to be staked and some shott to deathe’.” [SH105] Of course these elegant measures were restricted for fellow Englishmen: “This was the treatment for those who wished to act like Indians. For those who had no choice in the matter, because they were the native people of Virginia” methods were different: “when an Indian was accused by an Englishman of stealing a cup and failing to return it, the English response was to attack the natives in force, burning the entire community” down. [SH105] On the territory that is now Massachusetts the founding fathers of the colonies were committing genocide, in what has become known as the “Peqout War”. The killers were New England Puritan Christians, refugees from persecution in their own home country England. When however, a dead colonist was found, apparently killed by Narragansett Indians, the Puritan colonists wanted revenge. Despite the Indian chief’s pledge they attacked. Somehow they seem to have lost the idea of what they were after, because when they were greeted by Pequot Indians (long-time foes of the Narragansetts) the troops nevertheless made war on the Pequots and burned their villages. The puritan commander-in-charge John Mason after one massacre wrote: “And indeed such a dreadful Terror did the Almighty let fall upon their Spirits, that they would fly from us and run into the very Flames, where many of them perished … God was above them, who laughed his Enemies and the Enemies of his People to Scorn, making them as a fiery Oven … Thus did the Lord judge among the Heathen, filling the Place with dead Bodies”: men, women, children. [SH113-114] So “the Lord was pleased to smite our Enemies in the hinder Parts, and to give us their land for an inheritance”. [SH111]. Because of his readers’ assumed knowledge of Deuteronomy, there was no need for Mason to quote the words that immediately follow: “Thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth. But thou shalt utterly destroy them…” (Deut 20) Mason’s comrade Underhill recalled how “great and doleful was the bloody sight to the view of the young soldiers” yet reassured his readers that “sometimes the Scripture declareth women and children must perish with their parents”. [SH114] Other Indians were killed in successful plots of poisoning. The colonists even had dogs especially trained to kill Indians and to devour children from their mothers breasts, in the colonists’ own words: “blood Hounds to draw after them, and Mastives to seaze them.” (This was inspired by Spanish methods of the time) In this way they continued until the extermination of the Pequots was near. [SH107-119] The surviving handful of Indians “were parceled out to live in servitude. John Endicott and his pastor wrote to the governor asking for ‘a share’ of the captives, specifically ‘a young woman or girle and a boy if you thinke good’.” [SH115] Other tribes were to follow the same path. Comment the Christian exterminators: “God’s Will, which will at last give us cause to say: How Great is His Goodness! and How Great is his Beauty!” “Thus doth the Lord Jesus make them to bow before him, and to lick the Dust!” [TA] Like today, lying was OK to Christians then. “Peace treaties were signed with every intention to violate them: when the Indians ‘grow secure uppon (sic) the treatie’, advised the Council of State in Virginia, ‘we shall have the better Advantage both to surprise them, & cutt downe theire Corne’.” [SH106] In 1624 sixty heavily armed Englishmen cut down 800 defenceless Indian men, women and children. [SH107] In a single massacre in “King Philip’s War” of 1675 and 1676 some “600 Indians were destroyed. A delighted Cotton Mather, revered pastor of the Second Church in Boston, later referred to the slaughter as a ‘barbeque’.” [SH115] To summarize: Before the arrival of the English, the western Abenaki people in New Hampshire and Vermont had numbered 12,000. Less than half a century later about 250 remained alive – a destruction rate of 98%. The Pocumtuck people had numbered more than 18,000, fifty years later they were down to 920 – 95% destroyed. The Quiripi-Unquachog people had numbered about 30,000, fifty years later they were down to 1500 – 95% destroyed. The Massachusetts people had numbered at least 44,000, fifty years later barely 6000 were alive – 81% destroyed. [SH118] These are only a few examples of the multitude of tribes living before Christian colonists set their foot on the New World. All this was before the smallpox epidemics of 1677 and 1678 had occurred. And the carnage was not over then. All the above was only the beginning of the European colonization, it was before the frontier age actually had begun. A total of maybe more than 150 million Indians (of both Americas) were destroyed in the period of 1500 to 1900, as an average two thirds by smallpox and other epidemics, that leaves some 50 million killed directly by violence, bad treatment and slavery. In many countries, such as Brazil, and Guatemala, this continues even today. More Glorious events in US history Reverend Solomon Stoddard, one of New England’s most esteemed religious leaders, in “1703 formally proposed to the Massachusetts Governor that the colonists be given the financial wherewithal to purchase and train large packs of dogs ‘to hunt Indians as they do bears’.” [SH241] Massacre of Sand Creek, Colorado 11/29/1864. Colonel John Chivington, a former Methodist minister and still elder in the church (“I long to be wading in gore”) had a Cheyenne village of about 600, mostly women and children, gunned down despite the chiefs’ waving with a white flag: 400-500 killed. From an eye-witness account: “There were some thirty or forty squaws collected in a hole for protection; they sent out a little girl about six years old with a white flag on a stick; she had not proceeded but a few steps when she was shot and killed. All the squaws in that hole were afterwards killed …” [SH131] By the 1860s, “in Hawaii the Reverend Rufus Anderson surveyed the carnage that by then had reduced those islands’ native population by 90 percent or more, and he declined to see it as tragedy; the expected total die-off of the Hawaiian population was only natural, this missionary said, somewhat equivalent to ‘the amputation of diseased members of the body’.” [SH244] 20th Century Church Atrocities Catholic extermination camps Surprisingly few know that Nazi extermination camps in World War II were by no means the only ones in Europe at the time. In the years 1942-1943 also in Croatia existed numerous extermination camps, run by Catholic Ustasha under their dictator Ante Paveli, a practising Catholic and regular visitor to the then pope. There were even concentration camps exclusively for children!In these camps – the most notorious was Jasenovac, headed by a Franciscan friar – orthodox-Christian Serbians (and a substantial number of Jews) were murdered. Like the Nazis the Catholic Ustasha burned their victims in kilns, alive (the Nazis were decent enough to have their victims gassed first). But most of the victims were simply stabbed, slain or shot to death, the number of them being estimated between 300,000 and 600,000, in a rather tiny country. Many of the killers were Franciscan friars. The atrocities were appalling enough to induce bystanders of the Nazi “Sicherheitsdient der SS”, watching, to complain about them to Hitler (who did not listen). The pope knew about these events and did nothing to prevent them. [MV] Catholic terror in Vietnam In 1954 Vietnamese freedom fighters – the Viet Minh – had finally defeated the French colonial government in North Vietnam, which by then had been supported by U.S. funds amounting to more than $2 billion. Although the victorious assured religious freedom to all (most non-Buddhist Vietnamese were Catholics), due to huge anticommunist propaganda campaigns many Catholics fled to the South. With the help of Catholic lobbies in Washington and Cardinal Spellman, the Vatican’s spokesman in U.S. politics, who later on would call the U.S. forces in Vietnam “Soldiers of Christ”, a scheme was concocted to prevent democratic elections which could have brought the communist Viet Minh to power in the South as well, and the fanatic Catholic Ngo Dinh Diem was made president of South Vietnam. [MW16ff] Diem saw to it that U.S. aid, food, technical and general assistance was given to Catholics alone, Buddhist individuals and villages were ignored or had to pay for the food aids which were given to Catholics for free. The only religious denomination to be supported was Roman Catholicism. The Vietnamese McCarthyism turned even more vicious than its American counterpart. By 1956 Diem promulgated a presidential order which read: “Individuals considered dangerous to the national defence and common security may be confined by executive order, to a concentration camp.“ SUPPOSEDLY TO FIGHT COMMUNISM, THOUSANDS OF BUDDHIST PROTESTERS AND MONKS WERE IMPRISONED IN “DETENTION CAMPS.” OUT OF PROTEST DOZENS OF BUDDHIST TEACHERS – MALE AND FEMALE – AND MONKS POURED GASOLINE OVER THEMSELVES AND BURNED THEMSELVES. (NOTE THAT BUDDHISTS BURNED THEMSELVES: IN COMPARISON CHRISTIANS TEND TO BURN OTHERS). MEANWHILE SOME OF THE PRISON CAMPS, WHICH IN THE MEANTIME WERE FILLED WITH PROTESTANT AND EVEN CATHOLIC PROTESTERS AS WELL, HAD TURNED INTO NO-NONSENSE DEATH CAMPS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT DURING THIS PERIOD OF TERROR (1955-1960) AT LEAST 24,000 WERE WOUNDED – MOSTLY IN STREET RIOTS – 80,000 PEOPLE WERE EXECUTED, 275,000 HAD BEEN DETAINED OR TORTURED, AND ABOUT 500,000 WERE SENT TO CONCENTRATION OR DETENTION CAMPS. [MW76-89]. TO SUPPORT THIS KIND OF GOVERNMENT IN THE NEXT DECADE THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN GIs LOST THEIR LIVES…. Rwanda Massacres In 1994 in the small African country of Rwanda in just a few months several hundred thousand civilians were butchered, apparently a conflict of the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. FOR QUITE SOME TIME THERE WERE ONLY RUMOURS ABOUT CATHOLIC CLERGY ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE 1994 RWANDA MASSACRES. ODD DENIALS OF INVOLVEMENT WERE PRINTED IN CATHOLIC CHURCH JOURNALS, BEFORE EVEN ANYBODY HAD OPENLY ACCUSED MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH. THEN, 10/10/96, IN THE NEWSCAST OF S2 AKTUELL, GERMANY – A STATION NOT AT ALL CRITICAL TO CHRISTIANITY – THE FOLLOWING WAS STATED: “ANGLICAN AS WELL AS CATHOLIC PRIESTS AND NUNS ARE SUSPECT OF HAVING ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN MURDERS. ESPECIALLY THE CONDUCT OF A CERTAIN CATHOLIC PRIEST HAS BEEN OCCUPYING THE PUBLIC MIND IN RWANDA’S CAPITAL KIGALI FOR MONTHS. HE WAS MINISTER OF THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY FAMILY AND ALLEGEDLY MURDERED TUTSIS IN THE MOST BRUTAL MANNER. HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE ACCOMPANIED MARAUDING HUTU MILITIA WITH A GUN IN HIS COWL. IN FACT THERE HAS BEEN A BLOODY SLAUGHTER OF TUTSIS SEEKING SHELTER IN HIS PARISH. EVEN TWO YEARS AFTER THE MASSACRES MANY CATHOLICS REFUSE TO SET FOOT ON THE THRESHOLD OF THEIR CHURCH, BECAUSE TO THEM THE PARTICIPATION OF A CERTAIN PART OF THE CLERGY IN THE SLAUGHTER IS WELL ESTABLISHED. THERE IS ALMOST NO CHURCH IN RWANDA THAT HAS NOT SEEN REFUGEES – WOMEN, CHILDREN, OLD – BEING BRUTALLY BUTCHERED FACING THE CRUCIFIX. ACCORDING TO EYEWITNESSES CLERGYMEN GAVE AWAY HIDING TUTSIS AND TURNED THEM OVER TO THE MACHETES OF THE HUTU MILITIA. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE EVENTS AGAIN AND AGAIN TWO BENEDICTINE NUNS ARE MENTIONED, BOTH OF WHOM HAVE FLED INTO A BELGIAN MONASTERY IN THE MEANTIME TO AVOID PROSECUTION. ACCORDING TO SURVIVORS ONE OF THEM CALLED THE HUTU KILLERS AND LED THEM TO SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO HAD SOUGHT SHELTER IN HER MONASTERY. BY FORCE THE DOOMED WERE DRIVEN OUT OF THE CHURCHYARD AND WERE MURDERED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE NUN RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE GATE. THE OTHER ONE IS ALSO REPORTED TO HAVE DIRECTLY COOPERATED WITH THE MURDERERS OF THE HUTU MILITIA. IN HER CASE AGAIN WITNESSES REPORT THAT SHE WATCHED THE SLAUGHTERING OF PEOPLE IN COLD BLOOD AND WITHOUT SHOWING RESPONSE. SHE IS EVEN ACCUSED OF HAVING PROCURED SOME PETROL USED BY THE KILLERS TO SET ON FIRE AND BURN THEIR VICTIMS ALIVE…” [S2] IRAQ/AFGHANISTAN WAR OVER 2 MILLION MUSLIMS LOST THEIR LIVES AFTER GEORGE W.

You then leave school and implement the programming by working for most of the year to pay tax to the state. Once you retire you are still taxed on your pension and you still have to pay council tax. Then you die. In effect, your whole life is pointless and serves only one singular purpose, to pay tax. Of course, there is an added bonus, you can give birth to another tax slave or however many you want. They too will go through the same process and live pointless lives as tax slaves.” The man then sat back in his chair, looked up at the ceiling, then continued. “I feel that the state should honour each tax slave and give them a tax medal at the end of their life. This would be an affirmation of tax slavery that has been fruitful and give tax slaves a purpose in their imprisonment from birth to death. “As a tax slave you work and die on the job, you are servicing the coffers of the state, you are servicing the wars, the unlimited expense accounts of ministers and the duck houses, the royal family and many other things, I could go on and on, but I feel you would lose track of what I am trying to say. “Tax slaves have limited times with their families and friends, they do not really get to know their children, and they rarely get to know their true selves. They have no time for true moments, for creation, for cogitation and for realising the true meaning of existence and life. They are mere drones, working, commuting, and living useless fruitless lives to fulfil their tax payments to the almighty state. To live and die a tax slave is a waste of life, a terrible waste of humanity and a horrible meaningless nihilistic existence. “If you are a tax slave and reading this, look at your sorry life for one second. You are a slave, you commute every day at your own expense and spend many hours on trains or in traffic jams. Add those minutes and hours wasted into years and those wasted hours at work where you are degraded every day so that you can pay tax. You are not living a life, you are a living corpse, doing the same thing day in day out, in the system of tax payment until you die.” Sadly tax slaves will never be honoured. Why honour mindless drones completing their tax paying tasks day in day out willingly and without question? It might ruin their programming. We can’t have that sort of thing happening. Just continue what you are doing, day in day out until your heart finally stops and it’s all over for your meaningless sordid useless life.

We found a Quran in his hand luggage. The former president was given a full body search including his entourage. Michelle Obama was found to be hiding other objects on her person of which we cannot reveal as to their sensitive nature,” TSA spokesman, Arnold Felch told Fox news local.

At the time, the Queen was not aware of the monster Idi Amin would become as he had just come into power in Uganda. It was not until later in 1977 when it was feared that Amin would attempt to travel to join the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, documents show Britain “drew up elaborate contingency plans, involving the anti-terrorist squad and police marksmen, to detain Amin on his arrival in the UK and to eject him from the country”. By then, the atrocities committed by Amin would be fully known. During his reign of terror, 500,000 were put to death on his orders, and there were also claims of cannibalism committed by the Ugandan dictator. Despite Amin not making an appearance, the Queen remained concerned about the possibility he would try to attend the Jubilee Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral on June 7. Lord Mountbatten said he asked the Queen why she “looked rather cross and worried”. He wrote: “She laughed and said, ‘I was just thinking how awful it would be if Amin were to gatecrash the party and arrive after all’. “I asked her what she had proposed to do and she said she had decided she would use the City’s Pearl Sword which the Lord Mayor had placed in front of her to hit him hard over the head with.” To label someone like Trump as in the league of Idi Amin, is of course ridiculous, however our point here is to illustrate that the Queen has made state meetings with persons exhibiting dubious, despotic or totalitarian rule. The Queen has met the Chinese, for example, whose human rights record is one of the worst in the world. For the Regent, this is an unfortunate matter that has to be tackled, and her majesty does so very well with tact and regal dignity. This is why it is absolutely ridiculous to have silly socialists peeing themselves with their little petitions trying to ban Donald Trump from visiting Britain. Donald Trump has as much right as anyone for a state visit, and if we are to have continued special relations with the United States, it is imperative that we afford the correct hospitality to Donald J. Trump as any other president. '], ['5 Great Hotels to Stay in America For Muslims Visiting', ' Before you arrive at the hotel, there’s only one small problem, how to get into America unnoticed? Our Muslim travel guide for a Trump USA has been compiled after immense amounts of research and travelling. Our Islamic traveller flew from Abu Dhabi to Rome hanging on the plane’s undercarriage. He received a little frostbite on his fingers and lost four, but otherwise was fine. Once reaching Rome’s Da Vinci airport, he quickly stowed upon another plane headed for the United States, and the beautiful Big Apple, New York city. The luggage bay our traveller stayed in was delightful, the temperatures sometimes dropped to minus 15 Celsius, but thanks to him stowing himself safely in a trunk, he did not suffer the cold as much. On touch down in New York, it was easy for the Muslim to exit the aircraft once the baggage doors were opened, and the luggage was thrown onto a transport carrier. Continental Breakfast is served through a tube whether you like it or not for this hotel guest HOTELS The Flyover Boutique Hotel – This hotel is exclusive in that it is mostly outdoors under the freeway going from New York city to New Jersey. There is no room service or valet. Located amongst many cardboard boxes and discarded needles, you will enjoy your stay in America if you can last more than the night, as thugs roam the night and drug dealers with hookers in tow work the streets. Under the Floorboards of Mustafa’s House – You’ll have to be quiet in this hotel as if any visitors come to the home and hear you under the floorboards you may be deported or imprisoned immediately. There is no light, food or water and you cannot play the piano. The Ritz Sewer Drain – When it comes to New York luxury, it doesn’t get better than this. Check in on Monday, check out on Tuesday, either in a black plastic bag, or submerged under large amounts of sewer water. There is no room service, just rats, plenty of them roaming around waiting for you to nod off.

Already in his first five days in office, the Don has repealed Obamacare, started building a wall, and fired half of the State department who were linked to Hillary. That’s no mean feat for a fat guy pushing his seventies. So, what happens when Theresa May, the British PM comes along to meet the Don? First off, the internal memos have to spell her name correctly, that took about three goes, then the Don has to figure out how he’s going to speak to this stuck up British slut, because she’s making all the right noises on Brexit but barely delivering. “Dames come a dime a dozen, you just got to know how to treat the ones who have power. This May broad, I can’t just grab her, for a start, she’s British, they don’t like that kinda thing. So, I gotta shake her hand and smile at her, make it business, that’s what my adviser says. “No pussy jokes. She’s got a fierce British face with a pointed beak that could poke yer eye out. Nah, I’m not gonna try and fuck her, although screwing the Limeys on some trade deals would be good, I think I’ll treat ’em fair as long as they play on my terms.” Mrs. May seen coming off the plane certainly looked prime ministerial, there’s something about coming to the land of the free, where no one knows how to make a cuppa, and the wide grid like streets make everything look the same. Compared to tiny old Blighty, America is massive. No doubt, Theresa will be anxious to get to work immediately, and in her newly birthed socialistic tone, she will quietly denounce torture, and commandeer the chauvinistic pig that is the Trump from any manhandling. “I shall tell him to put it away. If he takes it out, or tries to grab a handful, I shall politely remove his hand from my nether regions and change the subject to Russian relations or EU matters,” May politely reveals once touching down. As the news will no doubt filter out later on in the day, everything will go swimmingly and there will be a new special relationship birthed. The return of Churchill’s bust to the White House, was the beginning of the relationship, after eight long years of horrid anti-British Obama rule.

The US will now revert back to the heady days of George W. Bush post 911, and a full frontal assault on the whole of the Islamic religion. There’s nothing wrong with that, many will say, however, this stance always fails because by further attacking Islam, one only fuels more terror, and recruitment into the fighting, defensive stance of their religion, many who were previously peaceful will join the fight against what they see as an unjust attack on their religion and lands. Under a Trump presidency, we will thus see a noticeable escalation of numbers of jihadists created, more terrorism and more ISIS territory gained. We will also see increased hatred of Islam within Europe and the United States, where citizens who overtly dress like Muslims will be attacked in the streets and told to leave. Trump has already talked about blocking Muslims travelling to the US, however he has not stopped there, he has also alluded to detaining Muslims in camps, away from the general populace. These camps are already being prepared, as they were previously FEMA camps, and the lists of known Muslims within the US have already been drawn up. Those who are armed will be rounded up first. The use of religion to create war is an old technique utilised by many throughout history, and Trump, with the Christian evangelists in tow is now on a mission from his god to decimate the Middle East further, of course with the full support of Israel. This is all a consequence of pulling the rubber band too far during eight years of Obama rule. At some point the rubber band snaps back to its original state, the state of deranged Christians and their false religion of peace. The state of the true white America.

To achieve greatness a civilisation must transcend its intrinsic evolution towards moral decay and this is why America fails miserably time after time. Any civilisation that revels in illusion so voraciously is always doomed to eventual failure. Looking inward will not save America but speed up its decline. Under Trump there will be no greatness, for he does not hold greatness within his own being, only moral degeneration and terminal egoistic sickness fuelled by incessant greed. There is a morbid death in Donald Trump, and once he acquires the previously unattainable he loses interest, this new play toy, this new building, this new woman. Trump will fuck America, like he fucks everything else, then discard it. The narcissist believes in his greatness and everything he touches turns to be great, but this is a false belief only fuelled by the narcissist’s immense unqualified undeserving ego and the mirror he looks in every day. Trump much like Obama will bring further ruin to America and the unfortunate spillage will consume the globe, for there is no greatness in an empire that only values material conquest, there is no value in chaos and destruction meted upon a system which undermines any logical civil conclusion or intellectual spiritual path . Much like Obama who preyed on ‘Hope’ and ‘Change’, Trump preys on blind nationalism, on Aryan supremacy, on greed, the pestilence of war, and more greed. There is no ‘Great’ within these limited bounds, only dispersion and humiliation. The future for America lies in destruction, in terminal decline, for every empire has had to forfeit its position, and the United States is cursed to die young. These Americans have not known or even bothered to look at cultures or civilisations that lasted for thousands of years, they have simply crushed them under rubble from their bombs and drones. Where Obama stood by, Trump will act, however both stances can only bring destruction in the end, because there is no solid ground to stand on. The US is a neural network of virulent predatory violence stood on a bedrock of supreme corruption and festering greed. America has moved too fast, and any civilisation that moves with such speed, such naivety and disrespect for the countless that superseded them is doomed to failure. In 240 years it has chosen to leap, but it has not looked at where it is to fall, and falling it is, fast, with no mercy or abatement. There is no greatness in proclaiming greatness, or trying to regain greatness, for you do not know what the word means. The beginning of the journey or path to greatness is not even acknowledging the word or even trying to emulate the tenets of accomplishments which only others can give to you, not yourself, or some pumped up meat packing bully like Donald Trump can evangelize.

I can see the clouds slowly parting as the sun shines over the gulag that is the internet today after eight fucking horrible years of Obama anti-free speech sovietization. I look up to the heavens and say what I want to say without having all my backlinks erased because of a story I wrote, or some omnipotent internet authority threatening me with complete erasure for not complying with the Obama anti-free speech doctrine. As the sunshine comes over the landscape the politically correct pieces of shit all look up and scream, their skin turns to dust as what remains of them are blown in the wind back down the drains where they came from. The Social Justice Warriors, an element of soviet conditioning try to run back into the darkness but are caught out by the the bright rays. They explode magnificently, blood, guts and their horrid authoritarian ideology disappear into the mire never to be seen again. I look up and breathe a deep sigh of relief, my lungs take in pure air, not the putrid soviet Marxist polluted air of Obama’s propaganda and his spendthrift waste. There is purity again, a cleansing of socialist detritus, the mainstream Obama press, once omnipotent, now impotent. Lo and behold, before me, above the horizon, the sun shines once again over the internet. Where there was a prison of controlled darkness, the spider’s web, the octopus like grip lifts, now there is light, it dazzles the eyes with its powerful beam of freedom and truth. In this truth beam, the real fake news is seen, and the holders of truth know that the trickery does not work any more. Their Mccarthyite witch hunt is destroyed in a single beam. Obama is no more. His evil stench flounders, he is a no more man, a man with no birth, a man who is nothing once again, tortured in his own mind every day with his failure. He has not achieved anything apart from oppression. He slinks back into the darkness, a shadow, a cringing decrepit stain on humanity, a boil on the ass of indignity, a festering turd left to rot on the side of a toilet bowl in some dive bar in Hawaii. Go back from whence you came. Your evil is not wanted any more. You have tried to kill the internet but you did not succeed, and you tried to kill freedom of speech and you did not succeed. You have maimed America, and watched as the world burned, and did nothing. Take your ludicrous inhibitive regulations, your gangrene ridden doctrine and flush hard, for it will all be erased soon, there will not be a trace left of your horrible tenure. You will have no legacy. Just nothing. Go back to your crypt, in the dank darkness, where the excrement is knee deep, your dungeon will be your home from now on. In the darkness you will find comfort once again, for you sought to bring that darkness upon the earth but failed miserably.

First of all, there are the multiple factions within parliament and the Lords who wish to thwart the will of the British people. These elements are embedded deep within the system and are doing everything they can to stop Brexit. We have the Blair, Mandelson, Osborne trio, we have the snivelling yellow puss bag, Clegg, and we have the Hillary Benn contingent, all waiting in the wings to spring up a little surprise for the plodding along Brexit. Lest we forget the multiple lawsuits against the government. Which leads us to believe that Britain is not ruled by elected members of parliament but unelected europhile judges, money grabbing prostitutes to whoever is holding the largest cheque and slipping it under their dusty white wigs. The third problem is Scotland, which is turning out to be a turd for the ‘United’ Kingdom. They hate everything and everyone down South even though England pays for every Scottish citizen twice over in benefits and free university, or whatever they demand the next day. It would be a good day to cut Scotland off and build a three hundred foot high wall across the border so they can wallow in their independent misery of poverty for eternity. If they want to leave so much, we should cut off this rotting limb from the UK sharpish, otherwise the gangrene will spread South. Let the little Krankie imp Sturgeon rot in her self righteous arrogance and Scottish nationalism, a horrible barren cunt of a woman who deserves nothing but pain. The fourth problem lies within cabinet itself, and these are Remoaners embedded in high places, Hammond comes to mind here, this is a man who holds the keys to the Treasury, and from his past actions has no stomach for Brexit. Theresa May, herself a Remainer, could have exited the country from the EU within the first month of taking office, but has dilly dallied for so long now, she doesn’t seem to know which way is up or down. Every week is another promise, one minute she wants a deal for all, the next she hardens her stance, and the next it’s something completely different. There does not seem to be any rhyme or reason to her stalling, but she has. May could have repealed the 1972 communities act within the first week of taking office, she could have enabled Article 50 and just got on with it instead of taking long Alpine holidays in Switzerland. Her delaying tactics allowed the myriad of lawsuits to take effect, for enemies of the people to resurge in parliament, and for the general populace to lose hope in a true exit from the evil clutches of Brussels. As we mention in the title, we’ll believe Brexit when we see it. Otherwise it’s all talk, all bullshit from the saccharine lips of Theresa.

Obamacare, Obamaphones, Obamafreebies, Obamatoiletpaper, Obama this and Obama that. “He’d come home and say the ‘gibsme’ culture is gone, now whitey ain’t ‘gibsing’ any mo. He was depressed. Here we had ransacked everything that whitey had and then they say we had to vacate the White House. Barack fell into dark times, he didn’t even wanna play golf no more, instead he got the secret service guys to score some crack or meth. The dream was over, our liberal progressive Marxist ideology had been ruined by one man – Trump, and that dumbass white bitch Hillary who couldn’t win a prize in a prize factory,” a woeful Michelle told our reporter. The road from the White House back door is a long one, and already Michelle is stalking the streets of D.C. trying to find a good cardboard box to maybe make home once again. If you staple a few cardboard boxes together you can add waterproof tarpaulin over the top to make it more habitable, especially in winter. It has only been a week or so since they moved, and already Barack has spent all the money the family had on drugs, he even sold some of Michelle’s dresses and trannie straps used to keep her male genitalia as flat as possible under garments. With no money, the kids left and are now staying with their boyfriends. “I don’t see Barack much, only one or two time a week. The meth he is smoking already rotting his teeth, and he get all violent with me but I is bigger than him and the other day beat him so hard his last tooth fell out. I said serves him right. But he says he wants the same high as being in the White House. He’s searching for that thrill of ordering white people around. He just can’t find it, and when I told him, I said it was all an illusion. He was just a nigger then and he’s just a nigger now. Nothing changes. Having a nigger in the White House don’t mean you ain’t a nigger any mo, it just mean they put one us in there as a token. Ain’t gonna happen ever again.” It’s Monday, and the Trump Inauguration will happen this Wednesday. What does Michelle think about that? “Pfffft. It’s offensive. Trump is offensive to me. Here I am in a cardboard box under a bridge and that ass wipe is the new prez. Maybe I should run in 2020. I want my dresses back, I want my useless initiatives back, I want to ruin school meals again, I gots me ambitions for mo multimillion holidays. By that time don’t know if Barack will be around anymo? Who cares any way, I’m more man than he ever was, I can do this.” As the rain pitter patters down in the freezing cold, Michelle pulls out a placard and begs for money.

The dossier he was carrying held the Golden Shower Trump video which we immediately put on the screen. The agent then said he would like payment of 230,000 dollars or he would imbibe us all with polonium milkshakes. When we asked what that was, he answered ‘Litvinenko, remember him?’ Luckily we pulled a switch on the agent, while he was not looking, one of our staffers took pictures, and used a portable hard disk fob to record the evidence in its entirety. We told the agent he should go to the Sun where they have big pockets due to being part of the Murdoch money empire. Sadly at the DS we don’t have two pennies to rub together, let alone thousands of dollars. Just ask for Rebekah, she’ll give you a large brown envelope I said timidly. The agent was not happy and said he could take us all out in less than 12 seconds, that’s when our sub editor shit himself, like literally pooed in his underpants.

According to a leaked U.S. intelligence report, Trump enjoyed the services of pissing Russian prostitutes in the same suite that Michelle Obama used on her visit. Kompromat As for the footage of this incident, let us hope it is never leaked onto the internet. This is something that could bring down many in the population with permanent blindness. The report, peppered with spelling mistakes, suggests that some in the U.S intelligence service are not very intelligent, and that much of the information displayed on the pages is hearsay. Apart from the fact that much of the allegations are non verifiable (unless one has the necessary connections in the CIA to check) there seems to be the slight massive fucking problem of leakage. What kind of an intelligence service leaks such a compromising document, which was meant to be Top Secret in the first place?

When the militarised police beat your teeth into the gutter, you will know no democracy lives in America!” But he warned “my major push for pc socialist censorship, mass surveillance by the state, media controls, and false democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted”. He implored Americans of all backgrounds to consider things from each other’s point of view, saying “we have to pay attention and listen to my Soviet repetition technique. If I tell you lies constantly, you will eventually believe them”. The country’s first black president, now 55, was first elected in 2008 on a message of hope and change. Hope and change however soon descended into despair and more of the same shit. His successor, Donald Trump, has vowed to undo some of Mr Obama’s signature policies including the disastrous waste of trillions spent on the ailing Obamacare fiasco. He will be sworn into office on 20 January. Raucous chants of “four more years of debt” from the selected brainwashed liberal socialist crowd were brushed aside by the president. “I’d like to but I can’t do that,” he said with a smile. US presidents are limited to two terms by the constitution. “No, no, no, no no,” he said, when the crowd booed the prospect of Mr Trump replacing him. Striking an upbeat tone, Mr Obama said that the peaceful transfer of power between presidents was a “hallmark” of American democracy, even though behind the scenes, Obama has been working on multiple plans to make things harder for the incoming president. But, he outlined three threats to American democracy – socialism, Marxism and everything I’ve been doing for the past eight years. In his closing remarks he said he had one final request for Americans as president: “I am asking you to believe. Not in my blatant lies and bullshit I have been telling you for so long – but in yours.” Returning to Chicago, where he first declared victory in 2008, Mr Obama delivered a mostly positive message to Americans after a divisive election campaign which saw Mr Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. “I love this town. Who got shot tonight? Raise your hands if you can. I heard 38 people were shot here in the last half hour. That’s better than last year, when we had 65. Hopefully next year there will be less shootings but I doubt it.” Mr Obama said that young Americans – including those who worked on his campaigns, and who believe “in a fair, just, inclusive America” – left him feeling “even more pessimistic about this country than I was when we started”. In choosing Chicago, Mr Obama had earlier said he wanted to return to “where it all started” for him and First Lady Michael Obama, instead of delivering the speech from the White House. (three gun shots sound and two gang members in audience drop down) Returning to Chicago, where he first declared victory in 2008, Mr Obama delivered a mostly positive message to Americans behind twelve bullet proof screens. Mr Obama said that it was in Chicago as a young man, “still trying to figure out who I was, still searching for purpose in my life”, that he “joined in at the bath houses where all the young men would congregate”. “This is where I learned that change only happens when you get stuck in there. I was trying to find my level of gayness, and I succeeded,” he said. “After eight years as your president I still believe that.” Some 18,000 people attended the farewell address at McCormick Place, the largest convention centre in North America where the night got off to a usual Chicago shoot out session. By the end of the evening police recorded over 145 gunshots, and recorded over 60 gunshot victims, some fatal. The tickets were given out free, but were selling online for more than two ounces of hashish each hours ahead of the speech. As he leaves the Oval Office, President Obama is viewed favourably by 57% of illegal immigrants and socialist brainwashed Americans, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, a similar level to Bill Clinton when he left office.

You would not have believed me. I added $7.6 Trillion to America’s debt and that’s not including the Trillions I added to the federal debt liabilities.

These easily hacked gadgets are an affront to home privacy, but it does not stop there, they also serve a very useful purpose for intelligence agencies like the NSA, and other national agencies. Facebook and other social media utilities are invaluable for data gathering on people, to evaluate who your friends are, your movements and your political proclivities. Social sites also serve a very useful purpose within the intelligence community to garner data on whole movements of people, to gauge the mood of communities and groups, and to perceive future movements of people, as well as threats to the government.

But politically correct snowflake students at the University of London are demanding that figures such as Plato, Descartes and Immanuel Kant should be largely dropped from the curriculum because they are white. School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)’s student union is insisting that when studying philosophy “the majority of philosophers on our courses” should be from Africa and Asia, “if the geezers had dreadlocks and smoked reefer it would be aight, innit!” said one of the students. Another student opined: “The fact that while the likes of Plato were discussing highly evolved ideas about civilisation 2,500 years ago, illiterate Africans were still living in mud huts. Ancient Athens was a highly developed society, with remarkable architecture, utilising highly advanced concepts of philosophy and mathematics. Two thousand and five hundred years later, Africa is much the same, people still live in mud huts although now some own a mobile phone, no doubt dropped in by whitey.” Unfortunately for the SOAS students, there were no African philosophers 2,500 years ago, and they have been searching for some evidence. If it weren’t for that idiot who burned down the great library of Alexandria, which was actually created by Ptolemy, a Macedonian, there may be more answers, however much to the attrition of the students, they have come up stumped to find any black philosophers of the age. Blacks like to cite ancient Egypt as the cornerstone of African technology and civilisation, however it has been proven by many archaeologists and scientists that ancient Egyptians were Mediterranean Caucasoid and not sub-Saharan negroids. Going far east, there is some light, where the students can find Confucius, whose lifetime nearly coincides with the ancient Greek philosophers, but finding anything in Sub-Saharan Africa will be a real task for the students.'], ['Brexit Now: 35 Hours On NHS Trolley Only to Die a Sordid Death', 'The NHS is at breaking point due to underfunding and mass migration into the UK The state of the NHS, not only from health tourism coming into Britain on a constant basis, but from abuse of use by EU migrants, and drunken louts, is a disgrace to behold. Call for an ambulance, and it may never come, that’s because resources are stretched way too thin considering the massive increase in population on this tiny isle called Britain. Dying on a trolley after a 35 hour wait is now just a common every day occurrence. You may be in dire straits, your kid is sick and unconscious, the ambulance never arrives, in desperation you drive to the nearest hospital but are greeted by hundreds of people. By the time it comes around to your ticket, five hours later, your child does not have a pulse. The overworked doctors and nurses simply shrug their shoulders, there is nothing anyone could do. It’s another day in the dying NHS, an overcrowded death factory, where millions of desperate sick humans fawn for a simple five minute session with a weary eyed sleepless doctor. Why not visit the wards, where no one speaks English, or the maternity wards where Nigerian women fly in daily to Heathrow to have their quintuplets all paid for by the British taxpayer, expensively delivered, lock stock and barrel. After they drop their sprogs, they’re on the next flight out, never to be seen or heard of again, unless they have some life threatening emergency that is. Naturally, there are no checks on the deluge into Britain’s hospitals, and anyone can get treatment costing thousands without a word being uttered. The sheer amount of wasted taxpayers money to health tourism per annum is astonishing, we’re talking £6 billion in eight years, not like a few quid here or there. Add on the massive influx from poor Eastern European countries, and the cost sky rockets although no one is saying a word about it. The NHS when it was first introduced was only built for Britain, not for the whole earth’s population. This is why it will not survive in its current form for another three years tops, maybe four if the current borderless situation carries on. It is imperative that Brexit is honoured, and that Britain’s borders are controlled heavily.

Hah!”'], ['George Michael’s Last Sordid Christmas', ' George Michael took a last needle full of heroin, as his boyfriend went to make another score of drugs from some festive drug dealer, a bloated mess on the sheets, this was not the George Michael of Wham, prancing around a TOTP stage in little white gay shorts, but a fat parody of himself, sweating, grey and already in the early throes of rigor mortis. All those years abusing his body had finally caught up with him, all those years in Hampstead Heath bushes getting buggered by white van men, must have now worked itself into a massive rectal prolapse, as befits these ageing homosexuals all too often as the medical fraternity would certainly reveal to shocked listeners if they were listening into a hospital conversation. The excess of cocaine, crack, weed and heroin always have their toll, as we saw a few years back with Michael slumped on his Range Rover somewhere on a roundabout in North London. Heroin is by far the most beautiful of drugs bestowed upon us from the earth, however it must be treated with the utmost respect, and not abused. One can live quite a fruitful life on heroin, only if used correctly. As in most cases, it is rarely used properly. The bout of pneumonia in Switzerland a few years ago gives us some clues as to the state of George Michael’s health, normal healthy people don’t nearly die from it, but those whose immune system has been depleted by HIV or AIDS do, and the pallid grey corpse of George Michael singing in concerts after his long hospital stretch reveal this all too well. That afternoon, as his gay lover came back from another score, he checked in on his beloved Greek lover boy to find only a lifeless body, one hit too many, or maybe a hit too late, as he could have been dying for the next score, or the AIDS finally kicked in shutting down his internal organs. We will possibly never know as the record company keeps things hush hush for post-death sales. The devil has finally taken his contract and soul, and he is far gone in the mists of Hades to care, as many would be in terror of the proceedings, it is most certain that George would enjoy it down there, especially with his masochistic streak. Aye, it’s another Christmas, and the celebrity flesh is falling much like rotting carrion from a passing plague carriage. “Bring out your celeb! Bring out your celeb!” is the cry from the man in the carriage as it passes through the streets, and a merry Saturnalia to you too. '], ['2016 The Year Satan Collected', ' Speaking from the crossroads, just east of Clarksdale, Mississippi, we asked the devil what business was like in 2016? “It been good, I got me a good crop this year. Bowie, Prince, George Michael. They had the full run of what I offered them. They signed on the dotted line all those years ago, and when it was time to collect, all I had to do was stand by and let their souls slip through. This is one contract they couldn’t get out of.” To have such musical icons lose their physical bodies in 2016 has been quite the harvest for satan but still he’s waiting on some big souls who have been holding out for way too long. “I’m still waiting on a friend, or two. The Rolling Stones will eventually roll my way again, they been holding out, I give em my respec’, but Mick and Keith, you’ve had your run and then some, I made you the greatest surviving rock’n’roll band in the world. Sooner or later you’re gonna have to come to papa.” Wearing a pristine black suit, black hat and sporting a toothy grin that could make milk curdle, the devil winks mischievously, then disappears in a puff of smoke, leaving a slight sulphurous smell. It’s just turned midnight, the crossroads is now empty.'], ['How Schengen Open Door Policy Was Downfall of EU Empire', 'Tourists lie on a beach as migrants and refugees from Syria and Africa arrive on dinghies and boats at the Greek island of Kos after crossing a part of the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece. The Schengen open door policy was meant to promote free movement of only the beautiful European people, the blue eyed, the blonde haired with successful professional jobs, country houses in multiple EU countries, and beautiful cultured friends tucked away all over the continent. It was not meant for sub-Saharans, or for Afghans or for all the rest streaming across Europe’s porous borders in need of housing, welfare, and sustenance. These are the tenets of what the EU project called for prescribed by the unelected EU Commission and EU architects all those years ago. Suicide by Schengen The Schengen zone was not designed for wars. The EU unelected elite do not know anything about military matters, they are only concerned about their economy and commerce and keeping the doors open to anything that comes through without question. They never even thought that the Schengen zone is a channel for heavy duty weaponry and bomb making equipment to be smuggled, or that hardcore, heavily trained militants could simply walk into the EU with no checks. The EU architects did not factor in that massive people smuggling operations run by criminals would benefit from the Schengen zone, or that smuggling high grade drugs would become so easy. Architects of their own destruction This leads us to believe that the architects of the EU are idiots, maybe they are intellectuals on some level but they are completely moronic illogical irresponsible fucking unintelligent bonkers mad elitest ass holes who have completely messed up the continent of Europe. You are a disgrace to the word ‘elite’ because you did not factor in all eventualities before you set up your little EU utopian Schengen project, which has left whole boulevards in Paris resembling a refugee camp, and allowed shanty towns to congregate on the sea shores of Calais. It is your irresponsible policies that have caused this mess, and the EU architects should take the full blame for their ridiculous insane EU hell that we are all now living in. If you count on safety and do not think of danger, if you do not know enough to be wary when enemies arrive, this is called a sparrow nesting on a tent, a fish swimming in a cauldron – they won’t last the day. The definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again with the same negative result, and this is what the EU leaders are doing. They are molly coddled in their own expensive cotton wool la la land of EU policies and diktats, but cannot see anything in front of their own eyes. The EU architects are visionaries of their own dystopia, the EU is a desert, there is now no hope or any future for the continent under the trampled shit splattered cloak of the EU. Lift no finger For those wishing upon the destruction of the EU, you do not have to lay a single finger, because the people who are running the show now are condemned to their own demise, and they will take the people down with them kicking and screaming. Such is the arrogance of the elitist eurocrats that they never admit to their mistakes, or their flaws, or their disasters, they will instead happily murder millions of people to keep their positions. May the Schengen open door policy be kept open for all to invade the continent, let us see how much anarchy, chaos and terror Europe can take before someone with some real logic does something.'], ['Nation Fallen: Germans Cowering in Politically Correct Marxist Cowardly Shame', ' Ein Volk, the proud German nation has been reduced to a band of simpering ninnies, opening doors to their own tormentors. Angela Merkel turfs you out of your own homes to house migrants, and you shrug your shoulders in acceptance, your ancient close knit towns now a seething mass of invaders, and you look away not even voicing any form of comment, let alone disgust. Communism means acceptance in defeat, and the German people have been defeated so many times, they revel in their own misery, accepting the pain, over and over again. Deep down in the German nation, there has to be someone to rise up, to bring forth the true spirit of the Germanic people, and to cast off this disgusting cloak of simpering victimhood that has befallen the nation.

Angela Merkel, a creation of Soviet East Germany, has sought to completely scramble Germany, to subjugate its people and to tear it apart with infiltrators who are completely different to its original inhabitants, not only in religion, but in every type of human cultural qualities.

For example, the Turks are said to be helping the Russians in cleaning up ISIS, however there are rumours that Russia is humiliating the Turks by siding with the Kurds, the YPG and PKK, and they cut off a supply route to rebels backed by Turkey in Aleppo. The official story is that Turkey is working with Russia on the ground in Syria, but there is no way to know this for sure as all news that comes from the region is contradictory. The Western media is no help, as they have little or no information about what is going on, although the intelligence agencies obviously know a lot more than the mere layman or press. To see how this assassination of the Russian ambassador plays out is a complete toss of the dice, either Russia can go ballistic or they can show some restraint and find the culprits. It is interesting however that the current news releases state that the gunman held a police ID badge and was admitted to the gallery without a blink of an eye. Could this be the next step in World War III? Our analysis sees an escalation in proceedings, whether in Syria or Turkey. We could see more Russian troops deployed in the region, but if the paranoia increases there could be recriminations towards the Turks from Russia, although this depends wholly on the results gleaned from Russian intelligence operatives who will be investigating this incident. When they do come out with a conclusion, should they be believed any way?'], ['Can Labour Be Trusted If They Support Russia?', ' Cambridge university, a staunch leftist breeding area, has factions that collaborate with Russia. Half of London is now Slavic speaking, and many Russians living in Britain today are actively working with Russian intelligence agencies to gather data. So, how can anyone trust the pro-Russian Labour party led by the greying old dog Marxist Jeremy Corbyn? “Well, if we were in a time of war, most of the Labour party and shadow government would be arrested or kept under a very short leash, they just cannot be trusted. The LibDems are most certainly Russian collaborators. This also applies to the SNP who are very pro-Russian and are inherently communists when it comes to their political views,” someone said just after leaving an establishment near Vauxhall bridge. Our national security depends on some kind of assurance that these matters are being dealt with, that these moles are dug up from our intelligence agencies, from our institutions. The Russian influence even extends to the Evening Standard and Independent newspapers, owned by Evgeny Lebedev and his father, Alexander Lebedev who was the First Chief Directorate of the KGB with a very dodgy dossier if one were to look at it. How could this turn of affairs have been allowed to materialise in the first place? Never underestimate the Russian threat to Britain, it is all pervasive and it seems the infiltration is bone deep. We must especially be careful with an upcoming general election in 2020, when it could be Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10.

Below is the video of Spotmini by Boston Dynamics who are contracted by DARPA. And here is the Chinese stolen copy of the American robot. This is obviously blatant thievery by the un-innovative Chinese, who have massively infiltrated DARPA and Boston Dynamics to steal their robotic concepts and designs.

Because of Theresa May’s dilly dallying within the first six months of her gaining the role of prime minister, and also her appointment of key Remoaners into the Cabinet, many plots to thwart Brexit flourished including a court case with EU-centric judges presiding over a nonsensical charge brought on by foreigners, and anti-British citizens. On all fronts, there are multiple attacks to halt Brexit, and due to the current Cabinet having little or no Brexit output, there is little cause for addressing the will of the people. The House of Lords, is a cesspit full of unelected bought-for cronyistic peers intent on destroying anything that even mentions the word Brexit. There is little or no chance that any Commons Bill would ever pass the Remoaner base of the Lords. The key point for voting for Brexit was to control migration into Britain to a sustainable level, unfortunately, because of Theresa May and her duplicitous diversional political stance, and indecisive nature, there is little hope of halting EU migration in the future, especially if the Hammond transitional plan is implemented. On June 23 2016, 17.5 million people making up 52% of voters voted to get out of the EU, to take back control of our laws, of our sovereign status, and to limit migration into Britain. These people who voted, who were assured by parliament their vote counted have been betrayed, and so has democracy within the United Kingdom been betrayed, by pandering to the EU, and to Remoaners at every turn, the weak Theresa May and her Remoaner centric Cabinet are nothing to do with Brexit and unless something happens drastically in the future, there will never be a Brexit as prescribed by the general populace. When all else fails, the country may very well fall into discontent, into violent expression for their disenchantment of what they thought was a democracy. Nationwide civil unrest will break up the UK into many factions, and there could be decades of violent street clashes as people fight for what is right and what they voted for. By betraying the will of the people established on a democratic vote on June 23, 2016, it is not only elected MPs who will lose their seats and constituencies but the economy will suffer as well. How many years of civil unrest can the government deal with, as people fight in the streets, escalating into open warfare on all fronts? Defying the will of the populace is a dangerous game, but if Remoaners wish to play, then they should be ready for the uprising after their treacherous attempts at derailing Brexit are unearthed for all to see.'], ['Klopp’s Team', ' Adam Lallana helped Liverpool to become second in the table during as his team beat Middlesbrough 3-1 earlier this December. Lallana was a real star of the game. Watching the game and witnessing the outcome it became clear that: Jurgen Klopp is a tough manager as he wasn’t afraid dropping Loris Karius, despite his great attitude and faith in his former goalkeeper. German player’s poor form started to effect the rest of the Liverpool team. Karius hadn’t made lot of mistakes on a field but it was the time to let him go. Moreover, Liverpool manager plans adding to his team new players. Best possible options are: Jose Gimenez, Uruguayan defender, Jonathan Tah, Jairo Riedewald and Jamaal Lascelles of Newcastle.

Another obvious thing that team’s manager admits is that Liverpool FC is not strong enough and Klopp struggles to cover for injured players – Philippe Coutinho, Daniel Sturridge, Emre Can and Joel Matip. From the other hand attacking midfielder for Premier League club Liverpool is getting better and proves his importance to Liverpool. Latest rumours suggest that LFC is interested in Brazilian teenager Thiago Maia and apart from Liverpool 3 more clubs are interested in promising player – Monaco, Schalke and Napoli. Liverpool FC doesn’t want to lose Philippe Coutinho, therefore is about to offer him a new £150,000-a-week deal in order to avoid landing him to Manchester City and Barcelona. The Brazilian player was in amazing form and provided 5 assists in 13 Premier League appearances, before having his ankle injured. Coutinho signed his contract 18 month ago but Klopp wants to make him one of the best-paid players at the club. Klopp reported that Brazilian player is improving a lot and manager feels positive about his future in LFC. Jurgen Klopp worked with some of Europe’s greatest talents; among them we see names of Robert Lewandowski, Mats Hummels and Marco Reus. Today he adds one more name in his list – James Milner, the former player of Newcastle, Aston Villa, Leeds, and Manchester City.

The limousine ride was pleasant enough, especially with a glass of champagne and hors d’oeuvres. Certainly a change from landing at the miserable grey facade of Heathrow and getting on the tube to go home. Trump Tower is an amazing place, once inside the atrium, you are struck by the sheer opulence of the garish gaudy surrounding decor, it looks cheap, but it isn’t. I was taken into the lift and have to say the elevator music was some of the best muzak I have ever heard, I literally wanted to bang my head against the wall but instead started to sweat profusely as the floors went by, until finally, ding, we were at the top floor, the suite, the penthouse, the palace of Trump, the gold leaf encrusted jewel of New York. The Italian marble floor was shipped from the finest quarries in Italy, and the chandeliers glistened like thousands of diamonds, maybe they were, who knows? On the wall in the main room was a portrait of Trump wearing what looks suspiciously like a cricket jumper and trousers. I didn’t ask, as Trump was not here yet, instead I was told to sit on a faux Louis XIV chair and wait. One thing I had not packed for my trip was a pair of sunglasses, because when the sun streamed through the window, the gold leaf, gold paint and faux gold furniture gleams with such severity that it literally blinds you. This place was heating up rapidly, and my sweat not only from nervousness, but from the heat of the sun on the gold was burning my skin. Maybe this is why the Donald has a permanent orange tint to his skin colour, but through the haze I finally heard a door open and a clumping of shoes upon lavish thick carpet towards my direction. Trump: So, you’re one of the ass holes in the Daily Squib? Gave me a hard time with all your bullshit! (smiling) DS: Er, yes Mr Trump, that’s our job, we were just keeping you on your toes, remember bad press is always good press, unless it’s the murder kind of course. Thanks for agreeing to the interview and major respect must be bestowed on you for coming through all of that to become president. Trump: You like my place? It’s the Sistene chapel of New York, the Versailles of Manhattan. (at that moment, Trump lets off a large fart, but continues smiling) DS: The gold everywhere is very classy, it reminds me of Dubai, or some other Arab lounge. You sure know your stuff Mr. Trump. Trump: Call me the Donald, or just Don, or Donny, that’s what my pals call me. DS: Sure thing, Don. Shall we get started? Trump: I just ate a burrito, so excuse me, this Mexican greasy food affects my bloated gut. (lets out a burp) DS: What’s your favourite war movie, this is the question I really wanted to ask, because I can imagine you at home at night, bored out of your mind, then thumbing through your vast collection of war movie DVDs. Trump: Boy, am I that transparent? It’s as if you hit the nail right on the head. I love watching war movies all the time because it relaxes me, war is the best, just the noise, the camaraderie, the whole shabang. My most recent watch list includes the Band of Brothers series, wow those Airborne boys sure were the best, and of course anything with Patton in it, you know Battle of the Bulge, and the film about his life. DS: You attended military school for awhile? Trump: Pa, sent me to the New York Military Academy over in Cornwall-on-Hudson when I was 13, he said it would make a man of me, and it did. Head of class, I would make those cadets shine their boots like no other and learned a lot about all things military. Like everything, tactics, strategy and looking after your company. I was destined for great things, and I knew it. DS: I’m not going to mention your Nam service, but I am going to say, you like war. Trump: War! I fucking love war. Business is war. Love is war. Without the fight I ain’t alive. I love to fight and most of all I love to win. We’re going to make America great again. I’m going to make sure of that and let me tell you, we’re living in war time right now, economic war, terrorist war, what they did to us in 911, that was the beginning of WW3. They started it, I’m gonna finish it. DS: Who started it? Trump: The Arabs, the Muslims. After my presidency they will bow to us, sheesh and not like Obama bows down to the Sheiks and Saudi goat herders. That’s all they are, if they didn’t have oil they would be herding goats. When I’m finished with them, they will be back to their beginning, in the sand, you know with a tent and some goats. DS: What about China? What are you going to do to them? Trump: China? China can kiss my big fat white ass. We’re going to teach China a lesson in manners, we’re going to teach those thugs that Uncle Sam is the boss, and not some Commie yella bastard who thinks they can play with our currency, dictate to us on trade, and bully Taiwan. You know when I took the Taiwan leader’s call the other day, I reassured her, I said I don’t like to see a dame in distress. We got your back darling, and let those Chins make the first move, we’ll send them back to the stone age. DS: There are so many problems to solve, you are not a young man any more if you don’t mind me saying. Trump: My wife keeps me young, that’s all I am gonna say. DS: What about ISIS? Trump: They’re a footnote in history. We’re teaming up with Putin to clean those roaches off the face of the earth. DS: But that means you’re helping Assad, and Iran. Trump: What the hell are you talking about? DS: Well, by teaming up with Putin, that means you’re fighting with Iran and Assad who are being supported by Russia. Trump: Lemme consult Mad Dog about that one. DS: Your new Secretary of Defence, General James ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis. What’s he like? Trump: When I say clean house, I mean clean house. He’s the right man to do it. No mercy. DS: You are a man of action, and after eight long years of Obama inaction, this is certainly a breath of fresh air, albeit with a bit of fear. Would you go nuke if you had to? Trump: Big question. (hands me plate of peanuts) Yes, if I had to, but only in the last resort. Of course I would like to see all these bad guys made into a glass filled crater, but they told me when I become prez, I gotta go through procedures. I can’t just go and blow people away because I want to, because things happen, radiation and all that. So they got me on a leash, for awhile, until I get to know those red buttons darn well. We’re gonna see what happens. Could be the big one, if it gets to that, get in your bunkers, it’s gonna be a fun ride. DS: Well, many people, especially the elite have recently been building lots of shelters, and when you are president, you will have access to the best stuff, the safest shelter of all. Trump: I’ve been down there already. They showed it to me, and I said to them, we need more gold plating down there. I can’t use taps without gold plate, can you imagine Melania on a bed that is not covered in gold or a four poster? There are rules that the Donald has to put out, so they listened to me, they’re on it. DS: What about the White House? It looks pretty Spartan compared to this place. Trump: Well, one thing is for sure, Churchill’s bust is coming back. They’re shipping out the Karl Marx that Obama looked at every day. You Brits should be proud. DS: Yes, that was a huge insult by Obama, but with the extreme left anti-British, that’s what you get. Let us also hope you don’t forget about Britain and that ‘special relationship’. Trump: Team Trump and Brexit are one and the same. DS: Yes, but there may not be a Brexit any time soon, especially when Theresa May, our PM, appointed many Remainers in her Cabinet and is stalling every day. Trump: That’s why I go through the man himself, Nigel, a great guy, he helped me so I am going to help him. I spoke to May for a few minutes, but she’s a dumb broad who is more interested in her shoes than Brexit. DS: Donald, returning to the subject of war, would you like to be known as the ‘War President’? Trump: Roosevelt was a great guy, a real war leader, and I look up to those guys, all I know is I will fight for America. Too many American kids today are little snowflakes, cry babies and emotional wrecks. War is the great equaliser, and I will be putting forward a plan for the draft to be reinstated. Made a man out of me the military. Our kids need to know how to buff up a boot, put on a uniform and be proud to serve. DS: I’m not sure that your proposal will go down so well, especially with the leftists. Trump: You know I don’t care. If we have to draft to defeat ISIS, Iran and China we will. Boots on the ground by the million. Okay, you got your last question, make it good, Stormy is about to give me my afternoon massage, and I’m late. DS: Who is Stormy? (Big silent pause from Trump) Ah, never mind. Well, this will not be so much a question but gratitude for allowing us a moment of Trump time. I know our readers will be eager to find new insights into the greatness of Donald Trump. Thank you. Trump: The honour is with me. Now take some cigars out of that box, and get the fuck outta here sharp. I need to grab me some pussy, like yesterday.

In a story reminiscent of the disappearance of 1981 Derby winner Shergar, the dog’s value is estimated to be worth more than £1 million. The empty kennel was only discovered on Monday morning, with no sign of the greyhound that is generally considered to be one of the fastest and best in recent years. However, with four men now having been arrested in connection with the abduction, there is every chance that Clares Rocket can still compete in the English Greyhound Derby next year, where is he the 20/1 second favourite with bookmakers Coral in their greyhound betting odds behind Bubbly Bluebird. Having disappointingly suffered an injury when completing his heat in the Irish Derby last year, Holland will be hoping that he can make up for it in England in 2017. Holland is one of Ireland’s highest-profile trainers and has led the training lists for a number of years. Alongside the success of Clares Rocket, Irish Derby winner Rural Hawaii and a whole host of other high class hounds are leading prospects for next year’s classics. Clares Rocket is undoubtedly Holland’s prized asset however, almost exactly a year ago to the day that the son of Confident Rankin and Lemon Madrid burst on the scene when winning around Shelbourne in 28.35sec for the 525-yard trip. He was fourth in the final of the Joe Dunne Memorial but then won six races in a row in hugely impressive fashion, before surprisingly missing the break in the final of the valuable Con & Annie Kirby Memorial Stake at the track, having been among the favourites in the greyhound betting odds with Coral. However, he once again showed his class to win all five preliminaries and the final of the BIF Produce Stakes at Clonmel, before running away with the Doire Construction Champion Stakes at Shelbourne. Clares Rocket returned from injury suffered at the Irish Derby to run second in the Night of Stars 550 at Shelbourne before being rested with a tough 2017 campaign in prospect.'], ['Italy Referendum: Going the Same Way of Greece', ' There will no doubt be a general election now in Italy, which in effect will determine whether Italy regains its sovereignty from the octopus grip of the totalitarian regime in Brussels, or it continues to limp along as a slave. This Italian referendum is a positive step in Italy regaining its sovereignty, and democracy if an anti-EU party is elected with the coming election. We have to however warn the Italians that freeing their nation from the EU will be a hard won task, not only because of treachery within their own ranks, but freeing yourselves from an authoritarian totalitarian entity like the EU is almost impossible. The Brussels politburo will not only make it very hard for Italy, but they will try and install a eurocrat as administrator to thwart the decision and will of the people. We have seen in the UK referendum how the treachery played out to flout the June 23 decision led by a minority of treasonous people and their cronies attempting to thwart 52% of voters has played out. No doubt, Juncker’s henchmen are beginning proceedings to install a Eurocrat into the post vacated by outgoing PM Renzi, a similar stance was implemented on an unruly Greece not long ago. Unfortunately for the Greeks, they were lied to by the Marxist, Tsipras, who promised the people freedom from the EU on the run-up to election, but subsequently backed down and bent over for the EU after election. The same thing will probably happen in Italy.'], ['Globalism Will Not Be Thwarted by Brexit, Trump – it Will Speed Up', ' Where the EU was a protectionist racket in trade, Britain through Brexit is a global trading partner open to deals, whereas the EU is restrictive. The same applies to the business dealings of Trump, who will access trade deals all over the globe, yet bring back some manufacturing to the U.S. which will increase global exports of American products globally. As for the EU, there is no reason why it cannot survive and thrive without Britain. The U.K. outside the EU should not mean ties will be lost, instead they could be strengthened. The EU should be left alone to pursue its dream of a superstate and EU army. The New World Order still has a long way to go to achieve its goal of complete union, partly due to the numerous rogue states which need to be reined in. Unfortunately, to rush things with global war is messy and costly for all sides, but the only positive factor for war is the speeding up of the process of change. To annihilate the old, one must have a clean slate, so that the new can be introduced effectively upon a cleansed landscape. Henry Kissinger, the head of the Bilderberg group, already has consulted with the president-elect Trump, and no doubt, a few choice words were administered to the incoming president. Globalism is much like water, and it flows through all obstacles adjusting and covering as much ground as possible. The Internationalists always win, because they have thousands of homes within one home and many hats to play with. When Angela Merkel holds an inverted pyramid within her hand, this means that the next move is a populist driven motive, still controlled by the apex of the pyramid. Whichever way you see the pyramid the capstone always controls everything, and the populist movements may not even realise they are being controlled. This is the beauty of Technique.

In a bid to resolve the issue of banning the upcoming president from the social network, Trump’s team have fired back. The War President “When Trump becomes president, we have to consider the fact that the United States will be on a war footing. We have to consider all areas of national security, and we have seen the lacklustre way Twitter, and other social networks deal with Islamic terrorists. To this end, Twitter could be a national security threat, as well as Facebook. These networks allow the transmission of terroristic propaganda and are not policing their sites by eradicating these messages. We would have to shut them down completely to safeguard our citizens, and preventing the spread of terrorist propaganda and messages,” a Trump security analyst revealed on Friday. This latest communique comes after Donald Trump announced that James ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis, a former Marines general will be the new secretary of Defence. Mad Dog’s favourite self attributed quote is: “Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.”'], ['Remainer Lib Dems, Labour, Tories are Pro-EU Marxist Communists', ' Capitalising on the weakness of a divided Conservative and Labour party, and led by the continuously exploding EU apparatchik, Tim Farron, the Lib Dems are now exuding an extreme left Marxist ideology which threatens the very security of Britain as a functioning nation. Communism is a very devious political ideology, and the Lib Dems are entrenched within its protective circle of deceit. Anyone who bleats the European Union mantra so stolidly is essentially someone who agrees with Marxist Communist ideals, and this goes for members of the Conservative party as well. In essence, David Cameron was not a Conservative in any way. His political allegiance lay firmly within the Big Society dreams of Karl Marx. His enduring allegiance was not for Britain to stay as a free thinking, sovereign state but to be swallowed up by the EU forever and slowly dismantled by the unelected Marxists who dictate all law from the European Commission. Former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso as a young, passionate Maoist student leader in Portugal, talking about a resolution adopted by the Revolutionary Students Commission on access to universities in Portugal. 1976 Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader is of course the consummate Marxist, and his plan is to completely remove any democratic forms from Britain, and to completely eviscerate the current system by first dismantling the Monarchy. Britain’s Monarchy are simply tokens of yesteryear however they serve a crucial role within the state and in bringing revenue to the UK. If by some unforeseen reason, Labour were to win the General Election in 2020, there is no doubt that Corbyn’s first actions would be directed against the royal family, eventually removing them completely from their positions and opening up their palaces to the people. This is what Marxists do, and no doubt there is quite a lot of anti-royal sentiment amongst the ranks of the Labour party and voters where this nightmare scenario could easily become reality. The recent by-election loss of Richmond to the Lib Dems is also a sign that Marxism is rife even within affluent areas, although this win could also be put down to ignorance as well, many voters do not realise what the Lib Dems are, and are also influenced by their anti-Brexit stance. Pro-EU = Marxist As mentioned earlier, if you are a europhile, you are essentially a Marxist. The EU’s collectivist strategies mark all the hallmarks of Communism. The authoritarian and totalitarian regime that makes up the EU, is pushing for a superstate, a Soviet construct that strips the sovereign status of nations it swallows up. Much like, the former USSR did with the countries it took over. All Remainers, either through ignorance or stupidity, are thus aligned to the Communist state of the EU. Just read the words of the former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev on what he thought of the EU. “The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.” Britain as a nation, therefore is in a tight struggle at the moment with those who fight for freedom, democracy and the right to sovereignty and those who wish to curtail freedom, to adopt Marxist Communistic principles, and deny sovereignty to our nation. These traitors to Britain, are called Remainers, and they wish harm upon Britain. That is where the hammer essentially falls, their wish is to destroy Britain, because if it is swallowed up by the EU Soviet entity, it will be destroyed bit by bit. The totalitarian tiptoe will not cease, and every year will see further destruction of our country. The EU is unrelenting and will not stop, it owns agents within the UK, it funnels money to these agents, whether in broadcasting, universities, parliament or the courts. Britain’s judicial system has already been severely compromised when recently a group of pro-EU biased judges ruled against the Brexit vote which was won by 52% of Britain’s voters on June 23 2016. Unless something is done urgently by the government to curtail this insurgency by Marxists and Communists who constitute the treasonous Remain camp, then Britain will be lost forever.'], ['How Romanians Colonised Britain in Less Than Two Years', 'What PMQs will look like in the House of Commons soon With the wonderful news from the ONS that 280,000 EU citizens came to live in Britain within the last quarter, where the majority were from Romania and Bulgaria, there is no surprise that the NHS is now close to certain death. It’s not only the health service though, schools are overflowing with some primary schools having to teach children in corridors, and 40-50 kids in a class. School places are all but impossible to find, much like getting an appointment from your local GP’s surgery. The roads are now so overcrowded with EU cars and trucks that having to spend two hours to complete a distance of three miles is an every day occurrence. No one speaks English in London any more, all you hear are Slavic languages, African and Romanian and every other language except for the local language. Naturally, EU residents are preferred for jobs because they are cheaper to pay and work longer hours, therefore putting the indigenous workers out of work. Jobs are now very hard to come by, not only for professionals but for trades people, who have been hit hardest by the deluge. Where a plumber from Romania works for £7 an hour, a British plumber would not even get out of bed for less than £60. The Ministers do not see what is going on because they are chauffeured everywhere and live in a cotton wool world where they are cushioned from such things. They do not seem to care, as the shoddy so-called Brexit never materialises and is possibly the longest on-going joke in the history of jokes. With private health care for them and their families, MPs never have to endure the massive waiting lists or no hospital beds, they never have to endure the agony of waiting in pain for an operation that should have been done eighteen months ago, but is continually put forward because of the deluge of people using the NHS. The daily flights of women from Nigeria landing at Heathrow to be admitted at maternity wards so they can give birth to their triplets and quintuplets for free on the NHS. Your child is sick, they’ve gone pale and their breathing erratic. You call an ambulance in sheer desperation. None come. Your child dies a painful death in your arms, something that would never have happened before the deluge. “Big Issue, Big Issue!” the Romanian woman shouts in your ear, her housing costs of £25,000 per annum are of course paid for by the taxpayer, her tax credits she receives are over £35,000, and that’s not including her income of £39,000 per annum selling people copies of the Big Issue. Britain for these people is the softest of touches, and should be milked for every penny. No wonder they are queuing up at Calais to come over, but it’s also easy for anyone who comes into the Schengen zone from Greece, or Italy to come to the UK. You just have to wait for six months to get your EU membership card, then come to the land of milk and honey to live a life of Riley on benefits in England. The future is one of morose death for Britain, there is no future for the NHS, because it is now so oversubscribed that it will not last for another two years at the most. This is however, what many MPs want, because they will eventually use this EU deluge to introduce a pricing model. This is what a lot of Conservatives have wanted for a long time, so it will be goodbye NHS and hello a model where all UK citizens will have to pay for their healthcare needs. The ironic part of this, is that it is the socialists who want to stay in the EU, who are actually contributing to the death of the NHS, which was created by socialists in the first place. They are of course too stupid to realise this. Britain’s cities are just nothing more than holding pens for migrants as they cram themselves into hovels by the dozen, exploited by ruthless landlords and lax regulation from the councils, who are told to turn a blind eye for the benefit of cheap workers. The benefits system, which was designed initially for the most vulnerable of society, is now used as a holiday camp, a ticket to free everything and the biggest lure for EU migrants who do not get as much elsewhere. With less taxpayers putting in to the pot, and more people taking out of the pot, it is simple mathematics, the benefits system will collapse along with the NHS. That will happen very soon, and there will be no lifeline left, socialists are good at using other peoples money, until that runs out. Then they are royally fucked. Don’t bother learning the Highway Code any more, because according to EU drivers, it does not exist. EU drivers rarely signal, they simply turn when they want to, they are rude aggressive and flout pretty much every road rule there is in the UK. They can park wherever they want to because their vehicle is registered in some shit hole village in Romania, so ticket away wardens, you are completely powerless to do anything. If an EU citizen crashes into you, they usually drive off, so good luck with your insurance claim, because they have no insurance or MOT. But they can get away with it because they’re from the EU. Britain has now become a stinking depository for the lowest human detritus, people of low skill, EU criminals, gang members, drug dealers who are overcrowding the already overcrowded. Instead of bringing in people of professional skill who would contribute to the economy, now there is a surplus of excrement and burdens to the taxpayer. Dig up the English countryside, so you can plonk on those garish fucking grey buildings, stacked up by the thousand to house the millions of EU migrants and their millions of children. There is no way out of the EU totalitarian regime, because the restrictions of leaving the EU are so stringent, there is literally no way out. If you can’t get out of something easily, you are a prisoner, you are tied into a totalitarian authoritarian regime, and the EU claims to be a ‘liberal democracy’ led by unelected eurocrats dictating laws from the EU Commission. The EU is in fact a Feudal state, where the peasant citizens have little or no say. There will definitely be no Brexit, and if there is, it won’t be a Brexit, it will be made to look like one but nothing will change.'], ['IMPORTANT: If You Voted Brexit Please Contact Your Local MP NOW', ' Brexit Means Brexit!

Satire The profound ignorance about the satirical literary genre is of course laughable, but it is also intrinsically sad, because here are these big so-called media ‘guardians of the internet’ people and they know nothing about satire, history or literature. They have never heard of Aristophanes or Juvenal, they have no idea about Chris Morris or Monty Python, instead their Americanized limited world view only sees things in black or white, yes or no, real or fake not as “a full dish of various kinds of fruits”. The Daily Squib was conceived on this very point, because it sought to challenge what is perceived as reality and fiction, and to mix everything into one big pot. Our role is for the viewer to question their reality and not to just accept blindly what they are fed through the mainstream media. If you question, you are one step ahead towards expanding your world view. To see the countless attacks on the Daily Squib by illiterate Americans is a sign that we are possibly on the right track, our life’s long mission is to WAKE YOU THE FUCK UP. Get up from your zombified Black Friday stupor and check your sources, learn about history and how it affects current affairs today, read a book or read thousands of books. Get some background on the massive amounts of knowledge there is out there, cram it into your brain, so when you read an article title you will immediately realise it is satire, which is a genuine literary art form in its own right, and is not ‘fake news’. Our site has been punished and nearly erased from the internet numerous times but we fought back, we never capitulated to the communists, and the (American liberal) socialists who wanted to shut down a voice beyond their peculiar Soviet world view. Socialists are meant to be progressives, however they have been found to be the most closed off people. Socialists do not appreciate another point of view, they censor, they cut off advertising revenue, they will do everything in their power to hurt our site. Socialists under the horrible eight years of Obama presidency have turned the internet into a Soviet gulag where only opinions from state sponsored news holds any merit and the rest is labelled as ‘fake news’. They are simply using the Soviet techniques of censorship, to brand any opinion that is not part of their socialist rhetoric as ‘fake’ and to limit free speech and freedom of expression. The Daily Squib is an equal opportunity hater, we fucking hate socialists, we fucking hate fascists and we fucking hate anyone in the middle. We do not allude to any political doctrine, or religious creed, or race, and are separate to any of these factions or ways of pigeon holing elements of human society/people/political doctrine.

This mass deluge of human traffic into Europe will be good for the United Kingdom’s Brexit stance, as an estimated 5 – 10 million migrants will push their way from Turkey directly into the European heartland, causing further unrest and problems for the EU, which has already been inundated with millions of migrants from South East Asia, Syria, and Africa. The open border with Greece, all the way up to the Black Sea will once again be open to traffic, and as more millions come, news will spread and even more migrants will make the journey. Turkey’s stance should be applauded in the destruction of the EU, as there will be limited capacity or enthusiasm for even more migrants. The numbers of migrants could easily increase to 20 million or 50 million migrants within a year or so, depending on the efforts of the Turks and their open door policy, as well as the forced reception within EU countries residing in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. Most migrants will naturally gravitate towards the leading EU nations of Germany and France, however there could be an increased bottleneck scenario occurring around Calais as some try to reach the UK. The Turks must be fully commended in their push for the destruction of the EU, and the increase in sentiment for Brexit, however it is the Schengen zone created by unelected eurocrats which will be their own undoing..a beautiful and just end to the masochistic EU, who engineered their own destruction through their own socialist utopian dreams.'], ['How Trump Used Alt-Right Pawns to Gain Power Before Disavowing', 'alt-right conference in Washington, D.C., where Trump’s victory was met with cheers and Nazi salutes Trump quite cleverly used the alt-right chump votes to gain power, but now that he is on the cusp of becoming president, Trump is dumping his voters for a more diplomatic stance in rhetoric. So, why did you do it? Quite simply, the alt-right, is a white supremacist fascist movement, and even though Trump may still hold fascistic viewpoints, his advisers have probably told him that he needs to tone down his nasty words a little. Chumps The alt-right vote was a surefire winner for Trump, purely because the followers would be guaranteed to vote for Trump, they are fanatical in their cause, and were fooled very easily into voting for Trump. As much as Trump courted the Ku Klux Klan, and other white supremacist Christian groups during his campaign he knew one thing that Hillary did not, and that is these are the silent ostracised groups within America who are guaranteed to vote for something other than an all inclusive democrat. There are many now within the alt-right fascist movement who feel angered about being used by Trump, but that’s chumps for you, Trump was the player business man who used these easily acquiesced pawns, then dumped the dumb suckers. Now that he got their vote, he is quietly disavowing them, and moving towards a more temperate pasture of vocal rhetoric.'], ['Experts: ISIS is Root of True Islam and Cannot be Defeated by Guns Alone', ' The Sunni Muslims were the first, then came the Shiites who bastardised the Islamic religion to their own dastardly vision. ISIS is the root of the current war raging in the Middle East between Sunnis and Shiites, and as much as the Shia faction is supported by Russia and Iran, the Sunni original interpretation of Islam is the dominant one. You can destroy buildings, bomb people, but you can’t destroy an ideology, an idea or a belief with military weaponry. You would simply be shooting into thin air. This is the fundamental mistake of any military campaign to ‘destroy’ ISIS, and any military action would ultimately fail, as the numbers of followers are too great. You can wipe out a thousand people, when two thousand will take their place, and so on. Regarding the actions of ISIS, these are seen by the West as atrocities, however, they have very cleverly masked their own atrocities committed in the name of Christianity in the past, which would far surpass any ISIS demonstration of violence. Let us also consider the fact that any ISIS member views what is permissible in the West as ultimately satanic, they live pious puritanical religious lives, but the satanic Westerner does not, instead he indulges in adultery, homosexuality, alcohol, drugs, pornography, gambling, debt and many other vices. To most Muslims these are seen as Haram, forbidden, and every facet of Western culture holds a permissive attitude to these vices. Therefore, to look through the eyes of these Muslims, what they are fighting against is a great impurity, a great sin against humanity. In their eyes, beheading or burning alive someone who indulges in these activities is almost a cleansing of the earth. Remember that Islam as a religion is almost 400 years behind Christianity in development as a semi-organised religion and the Christians have already passed through the beheading phase. This is why they commit these acts of extreme violence, because they are indoctrinated from birth to be pure, and to fight against impurity, which is what the West is defined as in Islam, an impure satanic entity. One could also argue that a clinical strike from 30,000 feet by a drone removes the nastiness of close up killing, and you would be right in your assumption, however at ground level where the bombed Muslims reside, they see first hand the damage these clinical strikes create. To them, it is all too real, the mangled bodies, charred beyond belief, and remains of those bombed. Yet, the Western operators of these drones simply see a puff of smoke, an explosion, then move clinically onto the next target. Is there an intrinsic difference to a clinical strike or a beheading by a sword? Both acts deal death, only the Islamic act is sensationalised on film, and the clinical strike is hidden behind a cloud of smoke and debris. They are both the same acts intrinsically because they take away life, albeit with different techniques. Here comes the crux of the problem, and that is how does one defeat ISIS? The only way it can be defeated is for every Sunni Muslim in the world to be slaughtered, and for Saudi Arabia to be completely destroyed. It is a well known fact, that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states fund ISIS, and to defeat them would be a massive task for the West, seeing as they have armed these countries with trillions of dollars of high end weapons. Furthermore, we have the silence of Israel. This silence at the atrocities committed against other Muslim factions by ISIS is quite understandable, because Israel does not necessarily see anything wrong with these actions. As far as Israel is concerned there’s some Islamic cleansing going on, and as long as ISIS is not knocking on their door, they should be positively encouraged and supported to carry on killing other Muslims. Donald Trump the upcoming president of the United States says he will defeat ISIS by joining with Russia in the quest, but they will be proved wrong, as mentioned earlier, you cannot defeat an ideology or belief with guns and missiles. You might as well throw trillions of dollars down a well, because the only way to completely eradicate an ideology and belief system is for complete global cleansing of 90% of the Muslim population. That amounts to approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide. Not only that, once 1.5 billion Sunnis are supposedly eradicated, all copies of the Quran would have to be destroyed as well and completely erased from human consumption, almost amounting to an impossible task in itself. Within the realms of the battlefield, ISIS is almost amorphous, they blend into the background, and can move easily. There are elements all over the globe now thanks to Obama’s eight year rule of nonchalance, and thanks to the EU’s Schengen zone, a corridor for free movement of arms and drugs, many have infiltrated Europe. Suffice to say, it is the West’s own policies that have created the vacuum for ISIS to flourish in the Middle East and as much as there are budgetary and time constraints on the West, the Muslims have all the time in the world. They in fact wish upon the West to be entrenched in this war for as long as they bleed it dry economically. Welcome to the next thousand years, this fight will never end, and maybe that is a good thing for some Western commanders, who depend on the arms trade, and who encourage warfare for defence spending increases. You cannot bomb an ideology or belief system. If you think so, you have already lost.'], ['Mexicans Say They Will Build Trump Wall – Three Feet High', ' Speaking from his presidential palace, Enrique Peña Nieto, revealed the Mexican plans to waiting journalists. “We have taken up the mantle to build the wall and will foot the cost as well.

As annoying as his predecessor, Farron is the epitome of Marxism at work, his politics stuck in a swamp of excrement, out dated and spoiling, rotten to the core. Here is a turnip that wants to scupper Brexit, and he is going on tirade after tirade trying his best to justify disallowing the vote of 52% of the electorate to leave the EU.

Marine Le Pen is sweeping to the helm of the right wing candidates and Fillon will be swept aside too in the upcoming French election in May, 2017. To be set free from the shackles of euro slavery, and for her economy to shoot up into the outer reaches of space, can the French maiden let loose from the darkness and reach her hand into the light to free France once and for all? Could this be another Trump/Brexit moment at the polls? The EU and its ludicrous Schengen policy has stifled France, muffled her voice and condemned her to the wild tax mad ramblings of the clinically insane Francois Hollande — a puerile man whose idea of economic embellishment is to categorically destroy everything with socialistic punitive taxes and burdensome mass unfettered migration. Can the rising Joan of Arc save France from being marginalised forever? The French are understandably fed up with the EU communist entity and will do or vote for a saviour from the filthy dank EU prison. The boulevards of Paris may once again be something to be proud of, instead of a stinking piss filled camp of degradation.

This scorched earth policy was witnessed in the last days of the Gordon Brown prime ministership in which he succeeded in burning the UK’s economy bringing it to the very brink of extension. As for referendums and other votes by the people, these are not honoured by socialists unless the results go their way. We can see what is happening today with the EU referendum, a vote that was conclusively for Brexit by 17.5 million people, 52% of the electorate. The vicious bad sportsmanship of socialists and Marxists are being witnessed now with illegal judicial trickery and they are doing everything in their power to derail the decision. There is no such thing as fair play or honour when it comes to these devout socialists who employ every dirty trick in their arsenal to back stab, renege on previous promises or legitimate democratic votes. They are not men of honour, they instead utilise nasty underhand cowardly techniques to destabilise and engender a scorched earth policy, all the while, whining and moaning with a collective droning sound. So, the next two months will be another example of nasty socialism that has lost, another example of how socialists use their power to punish those who voted against them. These disgusting, vile creatures will do everything now to get you, the populace who had enough of their control freakery, their underhand techniques, and their never ceasing effort to halt freedom of speech, freedom of expression and general human freedom.

The Europhile peer has claimed Britain needs intelligent migrants to come to the UK because ‘native’ Britons are ‘so bloody stupid’. Here is a man who has benefited highly from British taxpayers, who have serviced his chauffeur driven limousines, his first class flights, his mansions, and privately educated his children, calling the people ‘stupid’. Maybe the taxpayer has been stupid to finance this maggot of a human, a contemptuous traitor willing to sell Britain off to the lowest bidder. As for the intelligent migrants he speaks of, yes there are a few, but the majority are now selling copies of the Big Issue outside your local train station, or receiving vast amounts of state subsidies, burdening the NHS, and overcrowding the schools. Something Lord Maggot Kerr would not know about since he lives in his taxpayer funded mansions replete with duck houses and luxury. What he does not understand is that the premise of Brexit is not to halt migration completely but to control it.

Having pulled off a great feat through a general election, the Trump movement has followed a legitimate legal path to power, and have not utilised the violence of previous fascist movements to gain power. “We had to gain power through the legal American constitution, and once in power we will need to unite the American people under a singular cause. As much of a Pearl Harbor event, a 911, or Reichstag fire on 27 February 1933, this event we are waiting for will be cataclysmic and a profound unitary force amongst the population,” a Trump adjutant, revealed on Thursday. Unity in the American people is key, as there are many elements within the populace who do not wish for Trump and his movement to be in power. There will have to be a purge of the system immediately after inauguration, and all negative elements will be flushed away back into the sewer. The Bolsheviks within American politics and society have been routed in the general election, however there are many elements still at hand, lest we forget the Marxist socialist swine Soros and his cohorts of troublemakers. This is why Trump is mobilising the Einsatzgruppen to counteract this threat and to neutralise it once and for all. As in every fascist movement, there always has to be a common enemy, and these are primarily Muslims, who are now the new Jews, and after many years of media incitement and hatred sanctioned by governments worldwide, as well as engineered atrocities in the name of that religion carried out by black operation sanctioned Jihadists, the Trump movement has a very explosive adversary. Illegal immigrants, are also to be designated as Untermenschen, and designated a common enemy to the American people.

The natural progression from an external device, like a pair of goggles is to have a chip implanted into the brain directly which will link up with the synapses and billions of dendrites. These chips are already in use for the severely disabled, however their development is accelerating daily. Mapping out every channel and synapse in the human brain is a feat in itself, and they have already mapped out the brains of rodents and smaller creatures. “We can upload any scenario directly into your brain, you will feel as if you are there, you will see, smell, and feel every nuance the programmers introduce into the world, you will taste food, you will feel the wind on your cheek, every sensation you feel in the real world can be replicated in the brain directly through the zones activated by the neural implants. “This technology will be sold through the premise of perfect memory and data recall. Imagine going to a dinner party and knowing who the head honchos are to schmooze with immediate data downloaded into your brain, imagine being able to speak in any language at the drop of a hat, or recall any text ever written by man at the blink of an eye,” a scientist on the project revealed. The next step will no doubt be a jump from the intrusive machinery strapped on to our bodies to the discreet internal implants, and of course with every leap forwards there is always a leap backwards in freedom.

Players create and manage their city through the construction of various buildings, troops, and diplomatic endeavours with both AI characters and other online players. Many other strategic, browser games will leave players to their own devices and will have little to no tutorial. However, this free-to-play game starts off by taking you, step-by-step, through each building and the advantages of having each one.The simple tutorial quests will ensure that you are able to fully understand the game before leaving you to it. It is true, that, the tutorial may seem tedious for well-practised MMO players who are familiar with this genre of game. However, it allows for new players to join the fight and create their own city with little trouble. Whilst the main aim of this game, is to battle against the AI and push back the Persian Empire, players have the choice to help or hinder nearby, online players. Forming alliances with other players will ensure you have access to other essential materials, to your ongoing war against the Persian Empire. Additionally, online players who are willing to help each other rather than against each other, are able to form alliances and tackle other, online, groups. The key to survival in this game is upgrading your city, buildings and military units. As you slowly upgrade your city there will be a lot of waiting time, something that most MMO games will include. These days, game companies and developers are monetizing their games to their full potential and, with the long waiting times, players who have a keen interest in this particular genre always have micro transactions available to them. These micro transactions will be used to exchange real money for a premium, in game, currency. However, this particular F2P game, will allow players to earn the premium currency by completing quests; thus allowing players with all types of budget to continue through the game without having to spend their real money. For this type of browser, strategy game, Sparta: War of Empires boasts great quality graphics and there is no doubt that this game is visually appealing, with a lot of focus on the buildings’ intricate and well finished designs. Plarium have also given players the option of playing full screen, and become fully immersed in this 2D strategy game. However, the downfall most noticeable in the visuals is the lack of movement from the military and civilian units that you look after. It would be fantastic to see the minuscule characters move across from building to building. This small and simple tweak would certainly enable this game to stand out. Voice acting and historical characters are also included throughout this game. Whilst you journey through the quests and meet other players, you will have guidance from King Leonidas, a Warrior King of the Greek city-state Sparta who lived between 540 BC and 480 BC. Sparta: War of Empires is certainly a typical, strategic MMO browser game but adds unique features. After reviewing the game themselves, renowned gaming website, Gamesreviews.com suggested that this is worth a play. Is an Ancient Greece, strategic, online game for you? This particular multiplayer game focuses more around diplomacy and strategic thinking rather than combat but this isn’t to say Plarium haven’t included their fair share of action.'], ['Experts: Obama Helped Trump With Illegal Database', ' Thanks to Obama’s initiative to acquire a database of illegal immigrants in America, and a pledge of amnesty, which allowed many to sign up, Donald Trump now has a complete list of people to be deported from America. Every year many people try to gain entry into the United States utilising legal channels of entry, and millions are denied. It is therefore wrong that many others who wish to come to America can just walk across a border, and were encouraged to do so under the Obama administration. Trump has already outlined a plan to deport 2-3 million illegals who arrived illegally from South American countries and who pose a serious danger to the populace. The deportation of illegals with criminal records and links to gangs will be a first step, however there are still approximately 12 million known illegal aliens residing within the U.S.’s border, and these will be rounded up and deported in the next year or so. The logistics of rounding up these people and putting them on secure buses back to the border will be enormous. Some advisers are saying that there will be elements who try and flee from immigration control officers, however, they will have no place to go. They will not be able to work, or rent out a place to sleep, once they are caught they too will be rounded up and thrown out of the country. Many illegal immigrants are now going underground or fleeing back across the border, so Trump has a big job in front of him, that is if he does not go back on his word.'], ['Ignore Farage at Your Own Peril', ' Nigel Farage is also chums with Donald Trump, much to the dismay of May, who probably detests both characters, but she is going to have to put her little patterned shoes to the side for a minute and speak to the two men.

This is why it is crucial to end any acrimony towards Farage and Trump, and get on with making some serious money, trade deals between the U.S. are now front of the queue, whereas the EU is now firmly in bottom place. How the tables have turned in just a few weeks is absolutely amazing. The EU is firmly on the backfoot with little or no cards to play. Their protectionist racket crumbling before their own eyes. Who knows what happened to that Canada deal? Snuffed out like a cigar into Juncker’s cognac glass, a now distant memory to the Canadians, who are really sick of dealing with the procrastinating idiots in Brussels. In Theresa May terms, Farage must be the go-between between her and Trump, because due to her conduct in the exit proceedings, May has dithered, she has taken a long time and all the while the Remoaners have been allowed to scheme their little schemes. Because of her dithering we now have this High Court case stitch-up and various other nefarious schemes to put a halt to Brexit. Can May be trusted? No, is the short answer, and until there is full movement on the Brexit front, everything she says should be taken with a pinch of salt.'], ['Rubber Band Politics: How the Left Enables the Right', ' Pull a rubber band to its very limit, and it eventually snaps back. The government of America went too far to the left, the socialist pseudo Marxist strains of Obama thus enabled Trump’s win. No one could tolerate another four years of socialism especially under a ball breaker staunch feminist like Hillary Clinton. The natural state of human existence is a moderate conservative attitude, one of family and of conserving traditional values, the socialists wish to destroy the family, to destroy culture through mass migration at speed, to effectively destroy all traditions and norms as much as possible. This is why we are seeing a mass movement now to the right, people are fed up of the homosexualisation of everything, of the bending of all tradition, the PC, the emasculation of the male, and the dominance of transexualisation, the forcing of cultural racial integration. President Obama wanted the U.S. military to become a bath house full of homos and transsexuals, which in effect emasculated the army. Soldiers cowering behind walls more worried about their nails or make up, whilst real soldiers came over the top with their Russian grimaces, eager to bury their bayonets deep into the homosexualised American ninnies, trembling with fear, and pissing in their knickers. People want armies that can fight effectively, they don’t want Obama’s faggot army, they want real men who can do the job, and do not need to be mollycoddled at every turn. By pulling the rubber band so far, Obama and his ilk is responsible for bringing forth the right, they shamelessly were instrumental in the resurgence of the extreme right wing, as it moves to rebalance the vast move to the left. In Europe we are now seeing the cowering socialists doomed to years of purgatory, as the people rise up and remove them from office. Feminism has had its day as it is consigned to the dustbin, to be retrieved eventually when people have had enough of the right. This sort of rubber band politics, is one of extremes, pull, snap, pull, snap, and on it goes. People do not necessarily vote for the best candidate but simply because they’ve had enough of a certain regime or political ideology that has been prevalent for a long time. Yes, there is a sense of relief when the politically correct socialists are given the boot, because you can say what you want again, it is a real relief. Socialists claim to be progressives, however they inhibit free speech, how is this progress? The right on the other hand allow things to be said, but this in turn can in the future be taken to the extreme as well, as we have seen throughout history. One faction enables the other and work as a well oiled machine, and this is the mechanism that moves agendas quickly for the Controllers, who of course deal on both sides at the same time. Whichever side wins, they always win, and many voters are of course blind to such things. This is good, the voters must be ignorant to the fact that they are mere pawns in a bigger game. The core infrastructure does not give a flying fuck who wins an election, could be red, blue or yellow, they simply give instructions to the victor and the deal is done. How many times have you seen a government come in to power, and adopt the rulings of the previous government. We see this in Britain, where Labour increased CCTV surveillance by the million, then the Conservatives came into power, instead of reducing surveillance, they carried on with it, and adopted it fully, despite bad mouthing it when they were in opposition. Europeans of the right will bring racial intolerance, which is a natural human emotion and a reaction to the invasive qualities of sudden mass migration. Where the boulevards of Paris once were adorned with cafes, and sojourning Parisians, they are now replete with Africans on messy mattresses and tents, the once beautiful pavements adorned not with Art Deco lampposts but excrement and piss. This migrant influx is a direct result of the laissez faire attitude of the EU socialist elite who turned a blind eye to their utopian Schengen dream which turned out to be a road from the world’s poverty stricken zones to the West. Leftists should prepare themselves to an approximate thirty or forty years in the wilderness, and they have only themselves to blame. It is obviously impossible for leftists to be moderate, and this is their own undoing. Yes, but you say, what about Blair and Cameron? Well, these were socialists with a centrist marginal conservative attitude, especially when it came to finance. Their sole purpose was economical staying-in power politics and nothing else. Donald Trump, and Farage are a movement, and France will be the next focus. Once France is repatriated from the socialists, Germany will once again regain it’s pride in the Fatherland. Italy will follow as will the rest of the European nations. Schengen will be scrapped, as it is the road to self-destruction, and people hold a natural will to survive and not to die. The right is the correct way for human national survival, the socialist does not care for national survival, family or traditional human values, it seeks to destroy all of these in as fast a time as possible. Socialists seek to subvert human existence into a perverted bastardised form of malevolence they call progress. Human societal and political progress must be allowed to slowly evolve and not be pushed by socialist control freakery. Whether you are left or right of the political spectrum, in the end does not matter of course. These are all created constructs to keep the machine moving. Having elections every four years prevents civil unrest and rioting. That is the only reason for the so-called democracies that the West claims rule the globe. We all live in a democracy where if you go out into the street to protest, the militarised police will beat your teeth into the gutter with their truncheons and trample over you with their boots. Without one there can be no other, the left needs the right and so forth, to play off each other. Without sickness, the doctor would be out of a job, and without crime, the policeman would be unemployed.

To say the meeting was edgy and cold would be an understatement. Trump’s landslide victory at the recent U.S. elections caught many off guard, and liberals are all still in deep shock that their delegate Hillary Clinton was not elected. After the meeting at the White House, when asked about Muslims, Trump was at first hesitant about revealing his plans, but then answered emphatically that Muslims are a danger to the national security of the nation. No Sharia “I have already spoken in depth about Muslims. Our solution will be humane and just. Their religion is abhorrent and cannot be trusted. We cannot trust Muslims in our cities, our streets, our jobs. Look what happened in the San Bernardino shooting or the Orlando massacre? These atrocities were all committed by Muslims on U.S. citizens going about their daily lives. We can’t have this savagery amongst us. That’s why I’m calling for every Muslim to be registered in a database. We need to find out who the devout ones are, who the others are. We need to know if they own guns, and we need to stop their permits. We need to know and watch every Muslim in this country, and when the time comes I will make the final decision. We need to detain them until all the attacks stop. Detain or deport. We’ll give them a choice. Let’s not forget their mosques either, shut them down, we can and will do that. They have no place in America, a Christian God loving country.” Another reporter asked about Muslims who wish to visit the United States. “It’s common sense. We have no choice. There is already a no-fly list in place for known terrorists and criminals. Our policy in the name of Homeland Security will be that all Muslims are potential terrorists. Until the war of terror is over, this will be our policy. They can go and visit some other country, but Muslims will not be welcome in America while I am president.” As reporters rushed to ask further questions, Trump halted them and moved on with his entourage. There are fears for many Muslims in America today, as attacks on their person have risen by 25% already since Trump’s election victory. Many are now making plans to leave of their own volition.'], ['Forget Your Encyclopaedia Get the Pokiespedia', ' If you’re ever in Australia and you wander into a watering hole somewhere in the Outback or in a city, you’ll chance upon a pokie, and that’s when the fun starts.

For eight long tortuous years we have been witness to the incessant moaning of the leftist socialist contingent and their wishes to curtail free speech, to force their doctrines into peoples’ mouths, to promote their socialist utopian mirage that never happened upon the populace. As the Obama doctrine, a stout hatred of the British, a devout homosexual agenda and a consummate Marxist ideology were splattered onto every American orifice and fucked with lube, ends, it ends in shame, acrimony and the indignity of being erased completely from history without any recognition. Donald Trump will dismantle Obamacare, he will take down all these socialist executive actions, he will completely remove any evidence that Obama was ever president. There will be no trace of Obama in four years of Trump presidency left, and his legacy will be zero, just a grain of sand in an ocean of time. As for the global community, there will be a trade war with China now. The Chinese have for too long taken the U.S. for granted, and their time of selling Yanks cheap plastic trinkets that break after one day are over. Anything made in China is of the worst quality, and is immediately viewed as dispensable. The South Americans streaming over the borders will no longer be tolerated and encouraged, as much as the Democrats utilised these people as fodder for votes, those days are long gone. Look where it got Hillary? Mexico will be taxed to hell, and the illegals shipped to the border and thrown into the desert. Walk back to Mexico where you came from you dirty slickback they will say. If the blacks riot again, they will this time get a proper response, not the Obama response that was so prevalent during his tenure. There will be live ammo used on the blacks to put them firmly in their place. Anyone who says Trump is not establishment is wrong, he was not only born into the establishment but the people he knows are all establishment. One must remember that the establishment controls both sides of any argument, and whoever wins is always the establishment. When Trump met Kissinger, that was a clue that there was movement in his campaign, and this meeting alone should have signalled a change in sentiment amongst the controllers. The rhetoric used in Trump’s acceptance speech was far removed from the braggadocio and fascism of his former speeches, this is because Trump can now bide his time, he will cut down the Muslims in his own time, he will make his mark on Saudi Arabia, and Iran, in his own time, that will come. If you are a devout Muslim in America and dress like one, you will be targeted soon, so it is in your best interests to either assimilate into the American ways of dress and habits or to leave. You will be targeted in the streets, and you will be hounded out of town. This is why you must leave now, or later on find yourself in a camp, similar to how the Japanese were treated in World War two. A great war is coming, and even though Putin and Trump may seem chummy now, there is one thing you must never do, and that is trust a Russian. It is an impossible feat in itself, because how can you trust something that moves from one side to the other so quickly? We must prepare, and we must look to places of safety far away from any civilisation or U.S. interests to find that safety as the war will be long and vicious, possibly nuclear.

One can only hope that Black Lives Matter is buried under deep concrete never to be seen again, all the SJWs are taken out into the streets and beaten with bats, and the politically correct morons are told to shut the fuck up once and for all. The silent Americans seething for eight long years fought back, and to vote for someone like Trump was a breath of fresh air even though in an act of defiance against the whole system of corruption. As one maverick to another, there can only be an element of respect given to Trump, who just did not give a fuck, and has in one night buried eight years of hell under Obama, possibly the worst president of the United States ever encountered. It has to be said that eight years of blackness has ended, and we can all breathe a breath of fresh air and light, albeit with major uncertainties. Under Trump there will be war with China, there will be economic hell, and there will be upheaval but anything is better than more Obama or socialists.

She seems to be enjoying the limelight and fame of being one of the foreign interests who was instrumental in attempting to block 52% of British voters who voted to leave the EU. Posing in defiance, Ms Miller, a native of Guyana, brings out her new hat, acquired at some posh shop no doubt, or a betting shop lavatory to be more precise. “Do you like my new hat?” she scowls, as the primping begins in earnest. The photographer adjusts his lens, then sniffs loudly. “S’cuse me Miss, but what’s that awful smell? It smells like a turd that has festered in satan’s butt hole for a thousand years.” “It’s my hat, or shall I say crown. I shall wear it wherever I go from now on, and anyone who looks at me will see my beautiful crown that I wear so proudly, and think of me.” At that moment, four dozen bluebottle flies plop themselves on Gina Miller’s crown and tuck down to some good nosh. In the background, the spire of Big Ben looms over the scene, and as the coughing photographer clicks away, a wry smile comes over Gina Miller, she is the Queen today, the Queen of No-Brexit, and she will cherish this moment of fame for the fifteen minutes it will afford her.

Have to say that the PS4 version is a real beauty, because we are seeing graphics with improved visuals, including remastered, higher resolution art and effects, volumetric god rays, dynamic depth of field, native 4K resolution on PS4 Pro. Skyrim Special Edition runs at a solid 30 frames per second at 1080p illuminating stunning visuals and detail. Wizarding has never been so much fun as you toast trolls, and zap all manner of creatures till they disintegrate into dust, replete with immaculate graphics that throw you head first into the world of Skyrim. The PS4 version comes with support for mods, which is a major bonus adopted from the PC world. The original Skyrim sold over 22.7 million copies worldwide, so this latest edition should give the sales an extra zing. Alas, apart from the graphics upgrade, there has been minimal work on gameplay and combat, but let us hope in the future Bethesda changes this and goes full on on a major upgrade. The special edition, however, has added some major DLC content with the Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn expansions so there is more than enough for every Skyrim fan.

These people have been identified during the EU referendum and must be purged from the system otherwise these treasonous operatives of the EU could cause further harm to the British constitution and Britain’s national security. We have seen the damage already committed within the judicial system when EU operative judges were allowed to preside over the Brexit ruling and attempted to thwart the vote of the electorate on the EU referendum. The blatantly biased decision by these EU judges, one of which is Lord Carnwath, 71, who was one of four co-founders of the EU Forum of Judges for the Environment and served as the forum’s secretary general from 2004-05. The body exists to “promote the enforcement of national, European and international environmental law”. Lord Reed, began his career as an adviser to the Scottish education department, served as a judge in the European Court of Human Rights, who also acted as an expert adviser to the European Union Initiative with Turkey on Democratisation and Human Rights between 2002 and 2004, and the following year he became chairman of the Franco-British Judicial Co-operation Committee. The other EU judge is Lord Kerr, 68, who also sat as a judge in the European Court of Human Rights, ruling on a case in 2001 involving aircraft noise from Heathrow. Additionally we have Lord Mance, 73, who began his career working for a law firm in Hamburg, before qualifying as a barrister in 1965. His time in Germany gave him a taste for international legal affairs, and he has represented the UK on the Council of Europe’s Consultative Council of European Judges, which was set up in 2000 to advise the Council of Europe on the “independence, impartiality and competence” of judges. He has also served as a member of a seven-person EU panel that helps select judges and advocates-general of the European Court of Justice and General Court. These elements within the panel were clearly not impartial in their decision purely on their heavily entrenched links with the EU. Impartiality within law regarding key national security decisions like Brexit should be paramount to the judicial system within Britain therefore in justice terms, their decision to thwart Brexit, and the EU referendum result, voted for by 52% of the electorate, is wholly unjust and biased, bordering on corruption at the highest levels. The question of corruption should be implemented with a full public inquiry into how these judges were selected and how they were allowed to come to their obviously biased non impartial decision. We must as a democracy look into any form of clandestine payments given to the judges prior to their decision, and if any discrepancy is found it must be put right. A strong independent judiciary is essential to a functioning democracy and to upholding the rule of law, and these EU centric judges have proven that is not the case in Britain today, it is in fact entrenched in cronyism, corruption and bias. Britain’s national sovereignty is at stake, and treachery, corruption at the highest judicial levels must be eradicated to conserve our constitution. To purge the institutions of EU collaborators and clandestine operatives should be of paramount import in order to solidify Britain’s national security and overall sovereign status.'], ['Brexit Betrayal: Britain Must Prepare For Thirty Years of Civil Unrest and Riots', ' To simply bypass the peoples vote will not be tolerated by many and there will be civil unrest in the future if Brexit is not delivered. Mass rioting and looting in all cities will be the norm, because if there is no rule of law in our democracy, why should the people adhere to any rule of law on the streets? In essence, civil unrest is the last bastion of justice, and to have the conclusive EU referendum vote stolen by crooked biased EU centric judges will be their final undoing. There will be no peace, as the rioting masses converge burning everything in their path, who is to say what will happen, but when the anger envelopes the populace there is no stopping the torrent. It is better to fight for justice than to be timid, civil unrest is a disruptive tool that when utilised correctly can bring forth real change. Change that crooked corrupt judges commandeered by rich business people cannot do. Of course violence and looting is a terrible thing, but so is war, so is injustice, but these are necessary measures for survival, if nothing is done soon, Britain and its people will be no more. Already, we have been inundated, but if there is no Brexit, the numbers will increase tenfold, until the tiny island of Britain is nothing more than a holding prison, a junk filled morose, barren overpopulated garbage dump. Britain fought two world wars and was on the winning side of both, this time, the Germans will take Britain without a single shot being fired, this is the central position of the EU.

With this in mind, the currently unelected PM, Theresa May, will most certainly lose her position chiefly because of her dilly dallying regarding the Brexit process and her choice in putting key Remain MPs in high government positions and Brexit committees which undermined everything. Because of the unjust corrupt court ruling today conducted by biased judges, there are calls for a general election to be held before 2020. If this happens, there will be a bloodbath at the polling booths however under the current circumstances, if a general election occurs in 2020, there will still be a bloodbath. It does not matter when the next election is held, there will be a bloodbath of Remain MPs. Your days of parliament are numbered, so count them well.

The EU referendum was a legally bound vote with promises from the political establishment that the result would be respected. To have the wrath of 17.5 million people on you will not be a nice thing, it will not be pleasant because the people never forget, and the coming election will result in some major changes.

If the government had repealed the 1972 European Communities Act immediately the EU referendum result would be well on the way to materialising. The total nonchalance and denial of the EU referendum result is firmly on Theresa May’s head and her appointment of Hammond as Chancellor of the Exchequer was a further sign that May was not serious about the EU referendum result. Injustice The High Court ruling today which is intrusive and false, as well as being undemocratic is a further signal that we are currently not living in a sovereign nation and it is totally controlled by Brussels. During the EU Referendum, MPs had their say, MPs campaigned, and when it came to vote in the referendum, they voted. Therefore, parliament has already had a say in the EU referendum, and by going to the High Court, these traitors have sought to annul a democratic vote which was held on June 23 2016. This ruling is a shameful reminder that Britain has lost all sovereign status to the EU entity, it is a sad day for democracy, for the will of the people and ultimately for the country. 17.5 Million People Will Vote on Election Day In these circumstances, we must as a people show our displeasure at being circumvented by not voting during the next election for any MP or party who is EU centric.

In all certain terms markets across the globe will continue dropping and if you have any equity in your pension plans, you can kiss that goodbye too. Trump will bring heavy inflation to America, and the globe, where prices of consumer goods will sky rocket. With heavy inflation and low salary growth, there will be less money to pay your mortgage, and many will default on their payments. Feeding your family will be a hard task, as the supermarkets raise their prices to never before seen levels. How about paying $14 for a loaf of bread or $23 for some rice. With the equity markets tanking, the dollar (DXY) will fall to 23 in a matter of days rendering it useless to pay off even a portion of America’s vast deficit. China is already dumping their dollar reserves. Trump will be forced to cut welfare payments to all dependants citing no cash, but having the welfare bill cut will cause mass rioting amongst those who depend on EBT for food. Medical insurance, which is already skyrocketing in price will increase by over 400% when Trump tries to rearrange the insurance industry. This will mean only the very rich, like Trump, will be able to afford health care and the rest of the populace will be left in the dirt. Donald Trump is only doing this for his ego, he does not care for the poor. According to Trump the poor should all be mowed down by bulldozers and erased from America. He will only cater for the very rich, not the average American. Martial Law With extreme poverty, there will be civil unrest leading to civil war as some states will seek to secede from the union.

Antibiotics are increasingly becoming redundant due to overuse and the WHO has warned of a coming cataclysmic disaster where many ailments are untreatable due to resistance. “These people are spreading STIs around like candy and soon their diseases will not be treatable. It works both ways, deaths from syphilis and gonorrhoea will eventually cull these populations thinning the herd,” a clinical insider revealed. What about HIV? Unfortunately it has not had the effect in population reduction that was needed. Although it is still prevalent amongst the gay population, it needs to make more in roads into the heterosexual population to become effective in reducing the population numbers. Since the discovery of HIV/AIDS it has only killed 36 million, considering the global population is 7.5 billion and growing, it’s a drop in the ocean.

App developers need to make in roads in creating more hookup apps tailored not only for the developed world but for the third world, especially nations like China and India as well as the African continent, where population growth is beyond unsustainable. Once STDs like syphilis explode in these regions, which are wholly untreatable, they will continue to spread like wildfire. The creators of Tinder and Grindr should be commended for their great works, you have fired the starting gun in the race to reduce the global population before it is too late.

Who is to say how the female touch will affect Vladimir Putin, or some Middle Eastern despot? One could almost say the female is the deadlier of the species, and as much as guys like Vlad like to pose in macho photo shoots, having his balls crushed by Hillary Clinton could certainly bring him to heel.

Remainers do not believe in freedom, even though they do not want any borders, because their naive communist ideals do not realise the flood that will consume this country if the border is dropped. They do not realise that the NHS will not survive the deluge, or our schools, or our emergency services, our housing, benefits system, or our transport systems.

The sun cleanses the soul, and global freedom for Britain to trade with who we want, not to be restricted by the EU protectionist closed shop, an uncompetitive racket serving only the interests of corrupt unelected EU officials.

First thing Monday morning. We crashed into the bank and told the cashier to open the vault. There was little or no resistance as the lady just handed over the key and told us to go for it. This bank we know has millions, so we opened the vault, and we only found a few euros. I felt so angry as we had been staking this joint out for weeks. All in all we got away with six euros and forty three cents,” a tearful Leipzig told German news channel ZDF. The disappointed robbers were so shocked at the empty bank that they even lent the cashier twenty euros so she could get some food, as she had not had her wages paid for weeks. “We lent her some money, she was hungry and on the verge of starvation. I can’t believe they treat their employees so badly,” another bank robber revealed. The clueless bank robbers vow to prepare their next heist with more intricate planning and this may entail reading the news. “We didn’t read the news, we just concentrated on the technical details. All we had to do was read the news about Deutsche Bank and we would not have hit it. I’m sure my local launderette has more money than that bank. Absolute disgrace,” Liepzig added from his hideout. The Hamburg police have said they will not be pursuing the robbers but the CCTV footage was received with great laughter at the station. Hans Gruber, Chief of Police said: “When they opened the vault and saw nothing there, it was something out of a comedy show.

The dredged up nonsense from former Chancellor George Osborne, is another attempt by remainers (remoaners) to derail the Brexit as voted by the people on the June 23 EU Referendum. Firstly, they are not factoring in the many lucrative global trade deals which will be acquired by Britain, and secondly they are not factoring in the cost of EU membership, as well as the myriad of fines and restrictions the EU sets upon Britain. In 2015, the UK recorded a £67.7 billion deficit in the trade of goods and services with the EU, up from £58.8 billion in 2014. All businesses in the UK are subject to restrictive costs put on their business even if only a small fraction of companies trade with the EU. Brexit will open Britain’s trade up to the world, and it will not be restricted within the protectionist closed shop of the EU. All this talking down Britain, is another attempt by the incessantly moaning remain crowd, a bunch of Marxist anti-Brits who would sell their own grandmother to the EU for the correct price. The Remain people seem to enjoy totalitarian rule where everything is dictated to them, and where they pay £360 million per week to Brussels and are eventually conscripted into Juncker’s EU army.

Here is a strongman, Putin, seemingly fearless standing over his foes and adversaries, and yet his country’s economy resembles a ruined pile of smouldering rubles. Sanctions and low oil prices have seriously weakened Russia, and its economy. According to the World Bank the Russian economy has plummeted by over 40% since last year. Cut off from the global economy, the Russians are being starved out of their obstinate stupor by global restrictions and other methods of withholding economic sustenance. As is the case in most semi-totalitarian states, the military always comes first, therefore Putin is putting his all behind funding his war chest, however, if the economic decline continues, this strategy will suffer too. Keeping jets in the air is not cheap, and missiles can cost more than a Russian citizen earns in a lifetime. Unfortunately for Putin, this is the cost of being a maverick in a globalised world where all is entwined. Since the Ukrainian incident, Putin has been the bad boy, but there is still a way back from the desert if he so wishes to comply. Putin therefore has two choices only, stand his ground like a good Russian and wait for war, or rejoin the globalists, albeit at the back of the queue. By rejoining, Putin would be on probation for some time, and he may have to give up Syria and Ukraine, but at least Russia’s economy would once again regain its zing.

We are not sure why this omission would occur however, come to think about it, the Chinese are not mentioned either. “During our study, we also addressed the Noah’s ark tale. Yes, it is mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh on Sumerian cuneiform thousands of years before the bible was knocked up, but in the Christian bible, Noah received all the animals in the world before the great flood that god kindly created. If Australia is not mentioned in the bible, how did the kangaroos travel thousands of miles to Palestine across oceans to be included in the ark? What about pandas from China or the flightless Dodo from the island of Mauritius? Were these creatures, in their myriad of forms, magically transported to the Middle East by teleportation? We must also remember the Galapagos Islands, the Flightless cormorant does not have the ability to fly, so how the hell did it make its way to Noah’s Ark? The Flightless Cormorant’s pathetic little wings means it can’t fly. How it travelled from the Galapagos Islands to Noah’s ark in Israel over thousands of miles of ocean and land is a mystery even to this day. “The bible is therefore restricted to a very small part of the known Roman world and has no cause for the Aztec or Mayan civilisations in South America either. Certainly this is a strange thing because one would have hoped that the Christian god would know everything and everyone, to be timeless, and have all knowledge. “Our firm conclusion is not to our liking but it can be the only answer. The bible was written by numerous people who had limited knowledge of the earth as a whole at the time. They did not know about America, they did not know that kangaroos existed in Australia, and they certainly did not know that the Mayan civilisation were building pyramids like the ancient Egyptians. We are sad to conclude, that the bible has very little to do with god, and is just a man made book filled with archaic nonsense, moral tales for ancient people, and myths.

John Cleese, may be an old fuddy duddy escaped from a half filled dusty coffin buried in some apartment in Monaco, or wherever he is now, but he’s bang on the money, despite the outrage and ridiculous accusations of racism, he hit the nail on the head so hard it went through the floor. The Scots have colonised the press, they influence the English population on what is read and what is not read, and these Scot editors manipulate the news that you read/watch every day. Go through the list of all major news publications in the UK today and bang you hit a Scot dead centre as the editor. Of course, Scots have as much right as anyone to work anywhere they want in the United Kingdom, however the sheer proliferation of them within high positions in the news industry in England does beg questions. In a time where it is okay to be a proud Scot or Welsh person, unfortunately to be a proud Englishman is frowned upon and sneered at. This is the crux of John Cleese’s dilemma. Scottish Rite It’s not only journalism. Look at politics. Naming a few names, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling, Alistair Campbell, and on and on. One must consider the damage committed on Britain, on England by these politicians, who played the long game in inviting half the world’s population into tiny, overcrowded Britain. Lest we forget, Blair who was responsible for the biggest influx of people into the UK in modern history and a murderous war that we are still fighting. The stain of Gordon Brown is still very much around today, this was the man who sold off Britain’s remaining gold reserves at the bottom of the market losing the treasury billions in revenue and impoverishing the country further. He certainly did not have England’s good fortune in mind, and one can imagine him sniggering as the Queen’s gold was sold off for a pittance. Another one up for Scotland. Damage England bit by bit is possibly the Scottish agenda, and now that there is a little separation going on in mind and in political reality, the English must awaken to the parasites embedded in their system. Certainly, many of these plants have even lost the vestiges of their Scottish accents but they will damn well continue to undermine what’s left of England in their positions of power. John Cleese has every right to castigate the Scots, as much as Nicola Sturgeon continues to do her best to undermine the English. Here is a woman who supported Scottish Independence which would have resulted in Scotland leaving the UK and EU a few years ago, but is now calling for Scotland to stay in the EU all because of the positive Brexit EU referendum result. It is certainly good to see an Englishman fighting back. In this day and age of PC cultural Marxism, Cleese is a breath of fresh air, as for too long, the English have been so subdued, and fodder for cheap shots by all and sundry. As a race, the English do not know where to look now, they have almost become an amorphous race, invisible, angry and most of all tired of all this shit.

Well, all you need to do is check out this comprehensive guide on casinoreviews.co.uk for an informed unbiased viewpoint. If you’re looking for safe licensed betting, online slots that can make you a millionaire or you’re a beginner and appreciate guidance, all will be catered for in this detailed analysis. There are many variables in choosing the right online casino, and the guide delves into these in intricate detail. What are the bonus offers, is there an online app, what’s the support like, and most importantly is it a secure licensed establishment? William Hill has the most games on offer with over 500 slots, and some amazing payout rates. Bonuses are an ideal incentive to plop your cash on an online casino, but some casinos give you cash or free spins as an option. You must also consider the RTP (Return to Player) and these are calculated in percentages. These percentages are generally calculated over a long period of time and not on any single game. So, it is definitely prudent to keep a look out for the RTP. Additionally, you must consider the layout of the site. Is it easy to access information and games? Some casino sites are so cluttered with graphics and games that you don’t know where to look. This ultimately confuses the punter, but may be a bonus for the casino who play on these factors. If it’s user friendly, that’s definitely a bonus. If you’re playing live streaming games, such as poker, you’re going to need a good connection on your end, but most importantly the casino should have good enough server/s, back end, to deal with the bandwidth. You don’t want to be in a position where you are about to win a hand, and the casino goes tits up on their streaming. Safety UK casinos must adhere to the strictest licensing rules anywhere in the world, and this is why they are the most reliable operators. You can rest assured, if you’re dealing with a UK online casino it is regulated to the hilt, and not only adhering to the rules but in its online security. If you are not seeing an https, close your account and go elsewhere. Online casinos are all about winning, having fun while you’re winning, and carrying on even if you get a few losses. You just need a good system, stick to it, and soon enough you’ll see your bank balance bloating with enough cash to take a trip to Vegas in a yacht to carry on doing the same. All in all, UK casinos are a very safe bet when it comes to gambling, whether you’re a dabbler or a professional.

What Trump fails to realise is that running governmental offices is not like running a business, his rhetoric is geared solely to making a profit any way he can. Business people are only interested in profit margins and in Trump’s case he does not care who he steps on to make a profit. To have someone like Trump running the U.S. government would be a nightmare simply because his policies would be conducted like business deals. In diplomatic circles, business is a factor but not the primary concern. Within the geopolitical structure, yes money is of concern, but there are many more variables to creating multilateral deals. One must show some pity towards Trump and his deluded view of the world. Here is a person whose worldview is severely limited. It is thus within this blinkered tiny world that Trump exists, he does not see the reality or consequence of his irrational thought process, and only lives within a closeted cotton wool gold laminated eco system of business deals. To say that Trump is deranged and unhinged is an understatement. His childish nature hits back at the slightest note of disapproval. Here is a man who is only surrounded by ‘yes’ men, and naturally when he does not get his way, he lashes out blindly. Imagine this man dealing with the Chinese, how he could lash out needlessly and order bombers to fly over Beijing. He does not know the nuances in dealing with cultural differences, according to him everyone in the world should act like an American. Furthermore, Trump does not care whose toes he steps on to achieve his goal of supremacy, and the world would surely enter a phase of war whilst Trump is in charge. Sniff Trump himself has admitted that he does not read books, and his illiterate speech pattern proves this quite succinctly with his stumbling non-sequitors. Where Hillary Clinton is a very well read individual, Trump falters with poor verbal communication, bad grammar and an inarticulate sentence structure. Trump was given $14 million by his dad to start up in business, and from such humble beginnings he has forged an empire that does not pay Federal income tax, has been bankrupted six times, and is in serious debt. We have a duplicitous character in Trump, someone who refuses to show his tax filings, and operates in secrecy. It is no surprise that his dealings with the New York mafia in the past during certain construction deals engenders this secrecy. Does the world really need a dodgy business man with his fingers in so many pies trying to run world affairs? There is the question of how being a president of the U.S. could benefit Trump’s business dealings and whether there would be a conflict of interest. It is certain there would, especially with Trump’s cronies, who would no doubt get special treatment once he is elected. The major concern for all should be Trump’s easily baited nature. It is all too easy to trigger his competitive personality to do anything, including drop the bomb on China or whoever. As mentioned before, we should be aiming for clarity, logical thought and a solid foundation of political constancy over an unhinged individual who is floundering in the dark hitting out blindly. The world needs stability, not chaos. Vote Trump if you do not value your life, or the lives of your family. Trump will start World War III.

What the African Americans who are committing these violent crimes do not know is that their so-called protests for ‘equality’ are just a front for the formation of a Federal Police Force encompassing the whole of the United States under the sole control of the president. By incorporating a singular U.S. police force under one control centre, all states would achieve policing within a single framework of practice. This homogeneity would thus reduce any differences in state to state policing and prove more effective in population control. We must address the divergent instances of rioting by easily led African Americans who have played the game very well, and we must also address the unitary action of the higher command of police forces to unite under a singular federal force to police the entire United States. The Black Lives Matter group, funded by those wishing to introduce the Federal Police Force are instrumental in creating violence, looting, riots and should be applauded fully for their role in unknowingly being used for this purpose. Implementing a Federal police force will be easy, as the population and local states will be fed up of the riots giving the newly formed police force an opportunity to achieve its goals. Our greatest thanks to the BLM group and other easily manipulated groups for your hard work in creating a Federal Police Force which will be completed very shortly. Just a little note of caution to all African Americans and groups like BLM, once the Federal Police Agency is created, you will not be needed any more and you will be crushed if you try to riot again. There will be no need for your services after we have achieved our planned goal.'], ['Corbyn Steps Closer to Grand Prize', ' “For Jeremy and his supporters this is a great day because it is an indication that Marxism is alive and well in the Labour party and the country as a whole,” a Labour deputy revealed to the Mirror newspaper. Mr Corbyn has increased his mandate among the party’s membership having won 61.8 per cent of the vote and is the undisputed leader much to the chagrin of centrist and more right wing Labour members, MPs. As the Labour party confirms its push towards the extreme left wing of the political spectrum, there are ominous clouds dawning over the proposed 2020 general election. “One must consider that although the Conservatives have a large following in the country, there are also very large elements espousing Corbyn’s Marxist doctrines. There are also large numbers of the population who are alienated, non property owners, jobless, and poverty stricken who will always vote for their champion, Corbyn. “To this end, even though Theresa May tries to adopt socialistic ‘equality’ policies to placate these elements within the country, there is still a vast chasm separating the haves and have nots. “Jeremy Corbyn, could thus easily swing the coming election to his favour as the population may be tired of Theresa May’s Tories and her duplicitous agenda. Especially if there is no clear Brexit, or a soft Brexit, there will be many disaffected voters who either go to the right of May or even go left. The onus is on Theresa May to thwart Corbyn and his millions of supporters by conducting a hard Brexit to placate the majority of voters who voted to get out of the EU,” a Westminster insider revealed on Saturday. As far as Jeremy Corbyn goes, he has had the kitchen sink and its contents thrown at him and has survived a sustained onslaught from his own party members. This stalwart clinical holding on to the reins of power would certainly be approved of by the Bolsheviks, by leaders like Stalin, Mao and Lenin. Comrade Corbyn may soon lead his Marxist soldiers into Number 10, and Britain’s socialist system, which is the core of the nation, will be complete once again.'], ['Visit Charlotte North Carolina', ' Charlotte used to have a wonderful heritage and history but that doesn’t really matter now, especially while a bottle is being hurled towards your head thrown by an angry black.

That’s how they get you out of the game if they want to stop you expressing your point of view. Anything that is deemed as ‘negative’ by the YouTube stasi politburo i.e. any view that is contrary to YouTube’s political stance at that moment is thus deemed as negative. To illustrate a point, one could make a critical video of any politician and if that politician is affiliated with YouTube in any way, then your video will be marked down, you may get copyright slashes, you may get demonetized, or most likely you will simply not be seen on the internal search engines. So, how can a political satire site survive on a channel like YouTube? The hard truth is it can’t therefore, we have limited our use of that site, and until we find some place where free speech and free thought is appreciated we will cease to put out any material on that site. Now that YouTube’s soviet style censorship is going mainstream with the Heroes program, all the Social Justice Warriors (SJWs), socialists, communists and anyone with an anti free speech agenda will be interred into the censorship role. You too can be a snivelling snitch cunt and flag peoples videos simply because you don’t like the viewpoint being expressed by someone else. This YouTube program resembles a Maoist re-education camp where many were forced to go and learn how to be a good communist. Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, and George Orwell’s 1984, are all coming true more than even they could have dreamed up. If you ever do venture onto our YouTube account you only have to look at the timelines for all our videos and you will see a major cutoff from 2011 for views, from thousands per video to just 100s. This is because our site was deemed too political for YouTube as we were expressing views not appreciated by the Obama administration. Later in 2013, our sites links across the web were completely erased and our site was nearly blacklisted by Google. Sure, we have recovered some ground since then, but are still under surveillance and are constantly being monitored. Hopefully, when Obama leaves office, things may change, however we are not sure of this, because the system he introduced will still be in force. It seems the ‘Americanized’ web does not understand British humour, let alone satire, or free speech. When we say Americanized, we mean soviet because under Obama, everything has become about surveillance and snitching. This communistic technique of control limits freedom of expression, freedom of thought and is in essence an ominous program of total control that is now exemplified by the YouTube Heroes program where it is now becoming mainstream. In Soviet Russia, people were encouraged to snitch on their friends and families if they said anything bad against the communist regime, YouTube is using the same technique and is asking regular YouTube users to police their site for them and flag ‘negative’ videos. You too can be an unpaid informant, a snitch, a vindictive cunt of the highest order by joining the YouTube Stasi Heroes program. Yes, you will be a hero as you flag someones video, their opinion, or their work of art. Hope it makes you feel good to know that you are a slimy piece of crap, a worthless scum bag of the highest order..a true hero to your filthy freedom of expression hating masters. I disapprove of what you say, but will defend to the death your right to say it.

Gesticulating arguments and the smell is all too overpowering. Some are defecating in the corner of the room, it is okay in their culture. Mr. Soros is to stay in this room for 48 hours, with a good mix of races, some from Africa, some from the Middle East or South East Asia. Elements of the group surround Soros, his $45,000 suit stands out, and he wears a watch that could finance a home for twenty refugees. Ah, I hear you say, this illustrates poverty, not racism. You are right but wrong, maybe one should consider there is a link between the two. Soros, the only pale, well fed individual in the room is eventually pleading for his life. Where are his bodyguards now? He curses these darkies under his breath as they strip him of all he wears, then beat him into a pulp, leaving him quivering on the floor in his own blood and urine. You see everyone is inherently racist. From birth, if you can distinguish other colours, you are racist. It is a perfectly natural human condition. Now distinguishing and discriminating are two different concepts, but here is the crux of the problem, when one distinguishes, he chooses, therefore he discriminates from other choices he could have chosen. In most cases, from birth many stay within their own birth tribe/culture/colour/team/religion or whatever you wish to call it. This is the human conditioning working all too well, thousands of years of conditioning cannot be changed in a short time. Now, the elite globalists, are merely trying to shock the system. We are now seeing races and cultures from the deepest zones of the earth foisted upon the predominantly Aryan Western countries, who have never encountered such things before. This causes a natural culture shock to the nation involved in the program. The elite, are of course as racist as any other man, purely because they are exclusive individuals, but they are racist in educated ways, and this is why it permissible for them. Above the echelons and ramparts of the pyramid, an educated elitist from Burkina Faso can understand the elitist from Oxford, England quite well, as can the elitist from Beijing or Washington D.C. In relation to the current time we are experiencing now, one could postulate that the globalist controllers have overplayed their hand slightly, but to come to that conclusion one must first find out the modus operandi of these controllers. That, certainly cannot be revealed here in full, but if you think about it, by inflicting millions of culturally and racially different people onto an established predominantly mono-racial nation, many changes take place. A singular world, a truly global one world order, must eradicate the differences as much as possible in the mind of the globalist architects. Therefore, there must be a singular race mixed up from many gene pools, a singular religion mixed up from many religions and refined into one, and a singular banking currency mixed up from multiple global currencies. From the many, we move to the singular much more easily controlled state. A singular security force which will enforce the New World Order with great voracity from the temptations of jingoistic national fervour. The key to addressing the New World Order is how does one achieve this progression when blocked by certain nations who are staunchly unwilling to suddenly shock their citizens with a mass influx/invasion from different cultures and races? War is probably the only answer to those who do not capitulate to forced migratory quotas. War or complete economic depletion.

This event is like an earthquake in Hello land and the National Enquirer. Forget about starving refugees in Sudan and Syria, we must solve the Brangelina problem immediately.” The Russian contingent rose to the occasion by suggesting that the world population may be placated with two blow up dolls of the celebrities besides their menagerie of adopted children. “We could use blow up dolls, or for Ms Jolie a few sticks tied together with string. No one would know the difference,” Andropov Vladov, Russia’s delegate suggested awkwardly. The French delegate, Jean Renne Le Chateau, suggested that there should be re-runs of Pitt and Jolie films for the next month on constant loop in all countries. This way, he reasoned, people would actually be put off by the two as their movies were so awful and no one would care any more. It remains to be seen what the solution is to such a celebrity tragedy as the Brangelina divorce. Hopefully, it will all blow over in a few minutes and no one will care, the good news is Brad will be able to get a handful of tit soon and maybe Angelina may eat something for the first time in four years.'], ['Milo Yianapapapadopulos Prolapse Shame Live On Talkshow', "Surgeons try frantically to put back together Milo's wrecked ass hole Milo Yianapopoolus has come under increasing scrutiny from the medical profession after having a prolonged anal prolapse during another one of his narcissistic talk shows where he talked about himself at great length amongst goggle eyed Americans.

Speaking after the show, the doctor who attended the Greek boy was overcome by what he had sadly witnessed. “In this day and age we see a lot of things in our hospitals, especially from gay men who come in with all sorts of paraphernalia stuck up their rectums, however what I saw with this chap should be dealt with in medical journals.

He spoke some strange language and smelled rather awful. I was astounded at first as I had never encountered a darkie talking to me. I only star in period dramas where everyone’s white. Anyway, I gave the boy a hurried smile before he was thrown out of the building. That night whilst dining at La Gavroche, I felt a pang of guilt, maybe I should have given the boy a few pennies.” Ms Mulligan further states that Britain needs to invite all the world’s refugees into the country, but not in any neighbourhoods where rich luvvies live. “We couldn’t possibly have that. Imagine walking out of your mansion and seeing these poor peasants from this or that land walking about. House prices would plummet.” The sale of her current property is currently going well and Ms Mulligan hopes the Afghans she meets will be pleasant, especially the Taliban. “I sincerely hope they have something like the Garrick club in Afghanistan.

The Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) incorporates a large military structure including the Political and Security Committee (PSC), the European Union Military Committee (EUMC), the Politico-Military Group (PMG), the Crisis Management and Planning Directorate (CMPD) and the European Union Military Staff (EUMS). All these military departments work under the auspices of the European Defence Agency (EDA) however the dedicated military department of the CSDP will effectively be the fighting force with the joint EU army. The EU’s StratComm agency reports that the EU Army will hold positions within Western Ukraine on the outer sectors of the EU, and the conclusion for this folly can only be construed as a direct threat to Russia and its borders. By baiting the Russian bear, the EU military command hope the Russians make the first move justifying their operations in the area. The highly irresponsible formation of the CSDP circumvents NATO within the European theatre, and could destabilise global peace. Championed by current EU president, Jean Claude Juncker, and, German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen and her French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, the EU army’s strategic headquarters are to be formed in Brussels. War preparations are being conducted by the EU, as are the Russians who are building vast nuclear bunkers in the Ural mountains. Throughout history, France under Napoleon Bonaparte tried to take Russia in 1812, and so did Germany’s Adolf Hitler in 1941. Both were unsuccessful. Now that Russia has been weakened economically by EU sanctions, the plan for military incursion into the Russian federation is only too close. Maybe this will be a third time lucky for the Germano-Gallic coalition under an all encompassing EU army incorporating 27 EU states.

By doing so, British laws would supersede those of the EU once again. Magna Carta For thousands of years Britain has survived without the EU, and by reclaiming some of our own judicial power we can begin to take power back from the parasitical entity of Brussels and the unelected EU Commission. Regaining some semblance of Britain’s sovereignty and legal system is a first step away from the totalitarian Marxist EU regime. We must do this NOW The Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 must be adhered to in the interests of the safety of Britain’s interests in Gibraltar which is currently coming under increasing threat by Spain. Because of the Schengen Free Movement zone, Britain is increasingly coming under attack from elements sneaking into Europe across its porous borders. In the interests of national security, it is imperative that the UK takes back control of its borders. Without doing so immediately will increase terrorism within our shores on a par with what is happening in France. France is an example of a nation that has been severely compromised by its porous borders, where terrorists move arms freely into the country to commit atrocities on the population. Every part of France now is in a state of emergency where they can be attacked at any time at will by those wishing to commit acts of terror. Every day Britain does not secure its borders, the closer it gets to becoming France The threat of terrorism from groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda can only be thwarted by securing borders with proper checks and halting EU free movement, until that time, the attacks will continue exponentially.

The Turkish migrant accord with the EU has failed and this year millions have crossed into the EU from Libya and through Russian territories north of Greece which was the preferred entry point in 2015. Because of a news blackout ordered by Brussels, these massive incursions are not being reported by the mainstream controlled press. Every day thousands of migrants, who may or may not be legitimate refugees are pouring into the EU interspersed with terrorists who are utilising the cover of refuge to infiltrate the European Union. The Middle East is in a state of war, and the Schengen zone is an invitation for war to come to Europe.

The threat of a conscripted army made up of 27 nations converging on Britain is certainly something to think about. Could our currently depleted underfunded armed forces cope with such an invasion from the EU? Probably not is the answer from Major General Giles Viceroy. “Unfortunately, the MoD has been largely depleted under the tenure of Cameron. The Navy has been practically dismantled, and the Air Force is in dire straits. Budget cuts and mass redundancies has seen the British armed forces at their lowest ebb, all thanks to David Cameron.” Thankfully, there is still some time to prepare for such an eventuality as an EU army invasion on these shores. The current PM has to increase MoD funding by 190% and this way we’d have a fighting chance. “The British spirit is one that never gives up. We saw off that Hitler chap, Napoleon and the Romans, so we can certainly see off the EU army.

The Remainers are staunch communists who do not take votes as done deals. The EU is a Marxist entity and so are the supporters of the EU. They do not believe in freedom from totalitarian rule, and this is why they have taken over the government and hijacked the Brexit vote. We must do something fast, we must take back the reins from these liars, these vagabonds and traitorous deceivers; these turncoats who have no bond of honour or honesty between them. They are the ultimate enemy, because they are the enemy within, a far more dangerous adversary than the politburo and apparatchiks of the EU itself.'], ['Whatever Happened to EgyptAir MS804?', ' Lifting off from Charles De Gaulle airport on 19 May 2016, EgyptAir MS804 disappeared off the radar when it suddenly dropped from 37,000 feet cruise altitude. Shrouded in mystery No one knows what happened, and the French seem to be keeping the details of any searches or black box results very quiet. The Egyptians on the other hand point towards a terrorist attack, which is the natural logical hypothesis considering the planes altitude when it exploded. This begs the question, is it safe to fly from Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris, or any French airport for that matter? There is a definite reason why the French government is keeping this midair incident very hush hush, because if it comes to light that there is lax security at French Schengen zone airports, it will damage the already fragile tourist trade in France which is crucial to its ailing economy. No one seems to care really and it’s all very quiet..ho hum. Maybe they’re hoping it’s all forgotten.'], ['Revealed What Hillary Clinton Coughed Into Her Drink', ' We gave the tape to an expert visual analyst who worked for the CIA for many years, now retired, to try and explain the green deposit Clinton spewed from her mouth into a glass of water, then drank from. James Albright, a former CIA analyst gave us his take on the green gunk episode. “What we have here are two heavy objects that Mrs Clinton deposits into the tall glass of water. She has her lips close together when she releases these objects which I assume are quite heavy as they immediately go to the bottom of the glass. “The reason for Clinton having her lips partially closed is because she wants to disguise her efforts whilst ejecting the two objects from the audience. “After analysing the footage utilising specialist techniques, I have come to the conclusion that the two objects are human testicles, possibly from her husband, Bill. “Shape analysis and the weight of the objects, as well as the colouring. Hillary Clinton may have been chewing on them for awhile, and gangrene could have set in.” '], ['The Almighty Zuckerberg Beaten by Iconic Historic Photo', 'Phan Thi Kim Phuc runs down a road after a US napalm attack on her village. Photo credit: Nick Ut News coming in that Facebook has restored the previously banned photograph illustrating the horrors of the Vietnam war comes as a warning to politically correct anti-freedom and anti-free speech denizens of the Marxist left who seem to dictate to others what they can and cannot see or say. It is an increasingly scary thought that much of the internet today is ruled by these anti-freedom technology freaks who are scared of anything that is in any way real, creative or horrifically thought provoking. Technology is meant to free us and humanity more, yet they seek to shut us off from freedom of speech. The Daily Squib itself has seen the wrath of these freedom hating people who do not understand expression, art or satire. There is no algorithm for satire, and this confuses them, it does not compute in their cold sexless digital world of conformity, banality and boring morose technical speech. Mark Zuckerberg is a pox upon the internet, a vile humanoid creature with parasitic characteristics resembling a putrid bleeding pustule seeping across the world wide web. Facebook, where whatever you upload is now under the ownership of Zuckerturd and his brainwashed minions is a plague on humanity. It is the earth’s lowest form of achievement, it is an octopus that encircles every part of the internet with its giant suckers never letting go for one second. Anyone who has a private page on Facebook should be profoundly ashamed of themselves. Are you masochists? Do you like your information being peddled to marketing agencies, intelligence agencies and anyone else who cares to delve into your banal useless every day habits? Are you that fucking dumb that you will reveal everything about yourself even after reading the terms and conditions of that site? The uselessness of Facebook must be addressed. It serves no purpose to anyone, even the data gatherers, and the inane conversations from within its software prison walls are digital versions of sand blowing in the wind. Each word uttered is a grain of sand, lost amongst the billions of other grains of sand. You are nothing if you have two million friends on Facebook, you may slit your wrists on live streaming video and not one of these people will care, in fact in most cases of this nature, people egg on the soon to be deceased social media idiot to do the job quickly before they all move on to someone else to friend. To delete one’s profile now is probably too late, if you’ve been blabbing on Facebook for awhile, it does not matter if you delete, because all your information is on a server until the end of time. Not only that, if you visit any website on the internet that has a Facebook sharing link, you will be tracked and information relayed straight back to Facebook’s HQ for processing whether you have a page there or not. Is there a cure for Facebook? Well, as long as the NSA and CIA have their way, it is not going anywhere any time soon. The only way to kill Facebook is for the millions to leave it, but that will never happen because there are millions of brainwashed people living in their little sandbox, showing off their fake lifestyles and pictures of little Johnny at his birthday party. Facebook nurtured the narcissism of the people and marketed it. Facebook took friendship and made it into a commodity, of which you are the part, knowing or unknowingly. The only way to kill Facebook is to leave it. We cannot let something as invasive, as dictatorial and anti-freedom survive. Zuckerberg is even trying to erase history by banning historical photographs. This cannot be allowed in the West, whose tenets are ones of freedom of expression. Facebook is anti humanity, anti truth and anti free speech. Delete your page, you will feel much better for it. Interact with someone in the real world for one second. That’s all it takes. Delete.'], ['21-Year-Old Polish Player Wins EPT 13 Barcelona', 'However for young Polish Sebastian Malec money is not going to be an issue, at least for some time, as he recently walked away from the tables at the EPT 13 in Barcelona with a life changing sum of money, in fact a prize pot of over €1 million. Malec came away with €1,122,800 (£950 thousand) in winnings which when you consider it only ended up costing him a mere €27 to enter the tournament it was quite the return on investment. It was the last time that the European Poker Tour as we know would be in town and it’s quite an extraordinary way in which to seal its final appearance. At the end of this year the EPT will be going through a re-branding process which will see it return to the Spanish city in the future as a PokerStars Championship event, and one that will undoubtedly be headlining its returning champion. The win which took place over the 7 day event at the Casino de Barcelona had a total prize pool of €8,657,250 up for grabs. Malec finished ahead of both Germany’s Uri Reichenstein and Britain’s Adam Owen who finished in 2nd and 3rd place with winnings of €807,100 and €646,250 respectively. He won the trophy from the clutches of the experienced Reichenstein, who was typically on great form but who just couldn’t quite snatch victory from the hands of the 21-year old Polish star. Much like other pros from his country such as Dominik Panka and Dzmitry Urbanovich, whom have both previously reached an EPT final, it was down to Malec to keep that winning Polish tradition as none of his fellow countrymen have ever lost a heads up during the final table at a Main Event. Malec was very animated during the final, a total contrast to the calm, collected and almost unmoving stance of his competitor Reichenstein, and eventually it all paid off as he took victory. The story was reported on the Redflush casino blog as well as all the other top poker sites around and Malec is already being hailed as an exciting prospect for the future of poker. It was a popular win and he’s a very popular character who will no doubt soon be back on the circuit oozing with confidence thanks to his epic win and looking to take on other experienced veteran’s of the game who may next stand in his way. The win itself was in fact the biggest ever for an EPT Main Event champion playing in Barcelona and it was one of the most memorable tournaments for some time thanks to its eventual conclusion.'], ['The Science of Surprise', ' Ever been treated to a surprise birthday party or won on your favourite online casino games? We are all familiar with the feeling of surprise, whether it’s a pleasant surprise or a sudden shock whilst watching the latest horror movie, but have you ever wondered why it makes you jump or run around with excitement? So many reactions and changes happen inside the brain and body when something sudden and unexpected happens. Not only do your neurotransmitters start firing up, but all those tiny signals get your body up and moving, preparing you for any outcome that may occur. To explain a little further, the infographic below goes through step by step just what happens, as well as how and why, to help you understand why getting a surprise is such a happiness inducing activity.

When it comes to any mental health disorder, it’s always good to catch it as early as possible, in order to get the best help possible. If you find yourself looking after someone with the disorder, or even if you think a loved one or someone close to you may be suffering with early signs of dementia, there are specific warning signs to look out for, in order to get an early diagnosis.

However, It would be anyone’s dream to find a pile of cash or hidden, valuable treasures in an unopened storage box. That’s exactly what the guys on Storage Hunters set out to try and do. With a group of hungry bidders set to pounce on every box that presents itself at auction, it can be a bit of a gamble when it comes to the contents. Sometimes the hunters will hit the jackpot and see a huge profit on their investment, some will fall flat and end up with a pile of useless junk worth next to nothing. Whether valuable or not, it’s safe to say that there has been a fair amount of slightly unusual items found within these storage units. It’s hard to tell just exactly what’s inside with just a quick glance, and occasionally there will be something that shocks and surprises both the audience and the storage hunters themselves. The infographic below takes us through just a handful of the weird and wonderful items that have been found on the show and whether they were actually worth a dime.

What a beauty, our tech guy practically fell over after the ceremonial unboxing and as his saliva swelled up in his mouth, the froth resembling the head of a pint of lager on a hot summer’s day erupted onto the carpet leaving a nice little stain. This thing is indestructible, waterproof, and does not have a headphone jack. Yes, but can it survive a night out with the boys? Doing a pub run with an iPhone 7 was a joy to behold we found. It survived vomit, piss and even blood. At one point during the pleasant soiree someone unceremoniously spilled a whole pint onto the thing and it worked like a treat afterwards. Siri even burped loudly in appreciation. When mixing drinks, be sure to have an old doner kebab afterwards so it swills the drink up even more in your stomach and induces large amounts of vomit to blow out of your mouth at high speed. That’s what our sub-sub editor did, and we were careful to place the iPhone 7 directly in the path of the projectile vomit. Not a gurgle. The iPhone 7 survived after a brief wiping with someone’s best shirt. The end of the twenty pub session was indeed eventful as bladders were full to the brim. Bring out the iPhone 7 for the ultimate test. Fifteen red hot bloated bladders pissed on that thing and it worked afterwards with no probs. The night or shall we say morning culminated with a fist fight that lasted for twenty minutes, and the final test for the phone was revealed, the blood test. Yes, the iPhone 7 survived as bucket loads of blood were squirted from pummelled cheeks and fists. When the police arrived, they confiscated our beloved iPhone 7. We can conclusively say that the iPhone 7 is a winner in all situations. Highly recommended by all.

Jeez, if I want poverty I’ll go to India or Sudan, or some other godforsaken third world dung hole,” fashion critic, Monique Belucci told CNN. Kanye West who is currently in huge amounts of financial debt is trying to pay off some of his creditors by selling rags to rich people, but is it working? No, is the simple answer. The overpriced rags and bland clothes are not only ugly but can be knocked up by anyone by ripping a few pieces of cloth and wildly stitching them together. West has now had to fall back on his glamorous porn star wife who is footing his crazy bills, as he loses money like a gushing waterfall. “One has to look at the economics of this all. West is obviously not a business man. Here is a guy trying to recoup some money and pay off his vast debts by holding expensive fashion shows that put him in more debt. It just does not make any logical sense. I suppose with someone who has a registered IQ of 45, this is normal,” West’s belaboured accountant, who has not been paid for six months, revealed.

These barren women are the rulers of Britain and Europe, and maybe they wish to make their domains as barren as their wombs. Who is to say that Theresa May, she who delays Brexit for as long as possible, and she who backtracks at every possible turn will never conduct a Brexit as prescribed by the general population of the United Kingdom? On the one hand we have the despotic Scottish Sturgeon, a monstrous midget infused with her own self importance and aspirations of power daily threatening to commit some injustice on voters who voted to get out of the EU, on the other hand we have May, who would not look out of character on a broomstick with a pointy hat, a ghostly figure with wishy washy policies and ghost-like promises of Brexit that disappear into the cold dark night. There is nothing on the whole wrong with being a barren woman, however the vitriol and stink that can be meted out by some of these women should no doubt be noted, especially when they are in power. They have something to prove, they are angry childless, they hit out, they may be vindictive, even malicious in their anger at being childless. They will never know what it is like to have some little one tottering around the room or the playground. They will never know the joys and character building tribulations of being a parent. This makes them fume with rage at their diseased wombs, their childless, loveless existence projected onto the general populace as an angry apparition. Indeed, some may say these barren women ruling over us is dangerous, and it could even be stipulated that the world is entering a terrible phase of childless women in charge. Look at Merkel, a childless woman, and of course one cannot leave out Hillary Clinton, who managed to have one child, but in a marriage of convenience, how good is that anyway? The point being, Europe is now ruled by ruthless childless barren women. We must therefore prepare for war in the future, because it is this barren nature towards life that creates an atmosphere of anti-fertility, anti-family, anti-nature precipitating in conflict, war and eventually a barren landscape of death. War is coming folks, and the barren angry women shall make it so.'], ['Merkel’s Role Was Solely to Bring Forth Right Wing', ' Speaking from the shadows, an operative of the Hidden Hand agency revealed how the Chancellor is a simple pawn in a much bigger game. “We needed a rebirth of the German right. How better to do this than to bring in millions of Islamic refugees from the Middle East. The Chancellor was fooled into thinking she is doing a righteous job, but her role and the role of the refugees is one of being a conduit and aid to the right wing, of which is rising in Germany once again. All rises in fascism need a scapegoat, something to rally the people. In America we had 911, in Germany we had first the Jews, and now the Islamics. Merkel has been a gift to the right wing, and she is the gift that keeps giving.” With news that attacks against refugees and sympathisers has risen by 60% this year alone, as more people come into Germany daily, the attacks will continue until there is an apex in violence. Within the small German towns, tensions are extremely high. Here are small communities, entrenched, and the backlash has immense force to counteract forced integration with people the Germans are never going to accept. This fuel on the fire is rising daily, until the flames will be uncontrollable. “Merkel, as a pawn, has been exemplary, and the funny thing is she does not realise it. Thank you. You have given birth to the new fascism,” the operative added. In 1928, the Nazis had only 12 seats in the Reichstag; by July 1932 they had 230 seats and were the largest party.

This guy is not only a parasite within the music biz, but a parasite as a human, if one were to compare him to a turd, it would be a compliment,” one reveller quipped as he cut some wires to the DJs console. The devout homosexual Oakenfold, likes his little boys, but it is bending over for the likes of criminal Russian billionaires to get his sordid projects going that really irks.

Poppers “Mr Vaz was caught with two young men uphill gardening. Much like the first early potatoes, Vaz was grafting with all his might with the two boys, pinching out a few tender perennials and planting his tuber in the mulch. In other words, he was caught fucking a few rent boys,” a member of the parliamentary commission revealed on Sunday. Not that such a thing is a strange occurrence in parliament, but when the tabloids get a hold of this amount of manure, it really is game over, especially if you’re putting the charge onto expenses. Now we know why Keith Vaz was so eager to meet those young Romanian men at the airport.

Money talks, and a rich man like Drump was eventually hooked, hook line and sinker. What would it be like to have a president who has a wife with a shady past? Certainly her nude pictures posted all over the internet attest to her openness. Maybe she will titillate the secret servicemen in the mornings with a flash or three of her abundant charms. Who is to say she will not have orgies in the Oval room while her fat rich husband is in China on official presidential business. The life of a first lady can be excruciatingly boring while the president gallivants across the globe in Air Force One. No doubt the secret service agent will first be wary of her advances, but the first lady will be desperate, making it impossible for him to resist. Her obese husband has a tiny penis and has never been able to satisfy her desires. She spies the secret service men standing around all day and her womanly desires are sated to the full. The culture in the White House can be excruciating especially when your whole life is under the microscope. Hell, it’s bad enough during the primaries, but once you’re in there it gets worse. She may hark back to the good old days where she was paid to flaunt her body for magazines and photo shoots, and who knows what she did on the side? That is the big question but a woman with such talent in pleasing men has to do something for money, and being in New York city in the 1990s, scrabbling for a work permit, homeless, desperation kicks in. For women, it is easy, only too easy to profit from their natural charms, and this is what Vegania must have certainly done before she hit the jackpot in Drump. Money can buy you anything, and pussy can make money. The female body is a money making machine, cha ching, but she does not have to do that stuff any more. Sure, Vegania has to share her bed with a flatulating obese vulgar pustule like Donald Drump, every hour she stays with him she counts, every second, every minute, because she knows when her pay day finally comes, she will be rewarded for her hard work. Like many women, it’s a waiting game. They stay with these rich schmucks for as long as they can stand it until they push the lawyer trigger and get their delightful reward. As Drump’s weight presses Vegania down into the pillow at night, she dreams of better pastures. Maybe a sliver of spittle slowly strings its way onto her face, the Don is eager tonight his breath smelling of rotten garbage from a thousand dump trucks, he flickers his lizard tongue with eagerness knowing full well that he’s paying this woman by the hour just to be in his presence. Some would say that marriage is a form of prostitution, and for many it is. Divorce lawyers do not see any distinction between the married woman and the prostitute. They both charge by the hour, the difference being, one charges before service, the other, after.'], ['Burkini Ban Going Well in South of France', ' “We will not tolerate any show of religious zealotry or dress. The burkini is anti-French because it shows a dedication to a religion. Remember, it’s one rule for one religion, but another for another. Look at our nuns,” Gaston Dumerrier, Mayor of a small town in the South of France told Le Monde. The ruling came after more than 30 French towns banned the Islamic burkini, a swimsuit which covers the whole body except for the face, hands and feet and is worn mostly by Muslim women. Officials have said the ban on the outfit was a response to growing concerns about radical Islamic terrorism. Last month, a truck rampage killed more than 80 people in Nice, and attackers stabbed an 86-year-old priest in northern France. The thousands killed in the Middle East and Syria by the French is of course completely permissible. But human rights activists argue that burkini bans are illegal and that efforts to outlaw the garment are Islamophobic.'], ['Online Casino Games: Put a Few Pokies On the Barbie', 'Just think you put a few dollars in and the web casino stacks some of their cash onto your account.

I don’t know, I can’t believe it,” Streisand said, referring to Trump. “I’m considering getting a nose job to show my disgust.” A “thrilled” Hillary Clinton supporter, Streisand has spent the last few weeks campaigning for her preferred candidate. “I’m spending an evening sniffing around with Hillary in New York City next week, and I would love to meet you there. I hear she smells like fish. I don’t want to smell that bubkes Trump though, he smells like shit, bull shit to be precise, a real zhlub,” Streisand stated in an email sent out to Clinton campaign supporters Sunday. “I’m ready to do whatever it takes to help Hillary including whack Trump with my huge fucking nose.” Plastic surgeons in Beverly Hills are already queuing up to shave off some of that mass of cartilage Streisand calls a nose. Dr. Schwartz Openheimer, head surgeon at the famous Openheimer Cosmetic Surgery Clinic, revealed: “It’s the best Jewish nose we have in the biz. That thing sucks up yarmulkes by the dozen. But for the right gelt, I’ll straighten that honker out, make it look like a real straight streamlined goy nose.” “I love my Jew shnoz. It is sacrosanct. That means it is sacred. If Trump wins I might even get a normal nose. How tragic that would be,” Streisand emphasized before sneezing into five large tissues. The singer has even taken her campaign work to late night television. In a recent appearance with The Tonight Show’s Jimmy Ballon, Streisand blew a large green bogey across the studio straight into the mouth of an audience member who as it turned out later was a Trump supporter.

EU competition commissioner, the devoutly socialist, Margrethe Vestager said Ireland should recoup €13bn plus interest in unpaid taxes due between 2003 and 2014 after illegal aid stretching back 25 years. It is to this end that Britain should invite Apple to do business within the United Kingdom and we should become a safe haven to the economic madness of the EU. If the UK plays its cards right and makes Britain an attractive viable alternative to the EU, we will thrive even more, and the EU will be left with egg on their face with their anti-business policies. The uncompetitive nature of the EU stifles business and innovation. Its trade deals are protectionist rackets that stifle true international global business. Under a Conservative government, large companies like Google, Apple and Amazon should be feted to do business in the UK and not unjustly punished by the unelected eurocrats as the EU is planning. The EU has shot itself in the foot once again by seeking to punish Apple and this action will seal their doom further.

Cultural Marxism is a disease that is utilised to fracture nations, to weaken them from the inside, and once these useful idiots have been used, they will be discarded because they are too dangerous especially if they realise how they were used to achieve discord and chaos. The whiny irreverent voice of some name-taking social justice warrior American woman may make you cringe and want to lobotomise yourself, but it is a very succinct illustration into how society has deteriorated to such a low level. Certainly, it would be perfectly permissible to bury an axe deep into Annaliese Nielsen’s cranium to put her out of her misery, unfortunately we can only imagine doing so. Socialist Education System America has been destabilised, and it may take many generations of education to turn back the clock. One would think that any sane logical person would see this deterioration manifesting however the ideology of Marxism and socialism is so entrenched within the American education system that it may be too late for any change. Hillary Clinton will win the 2016 election irrespective of any Trump aspirations, and this is the agenda. The election was done and dusted months, years ago and nothing can be done to change this fact. Idealogical Subversion The socialism has to go on, because all facets of American patriotism and culture has to be destroyed from within, so when the Russians and Chins roll in, they will have little or no resistance. The first thing the invaders will do of course is to line up all the socialists and SJWs against a wall and shoot them in the head. They would have fulfilled their purpose and the Russians and Chinese do not want them fighting back once they realise how they were used.

Why put someone like a staunch Remainer Philip Hammond as the Chancellor of the Exchequer? This is the ultimate question that must be asked, because this putrid excuse for a Briton is a Remainer, a person who is against Britain’s freedom from the EU, a person who would sell Britain down the river at the drop of a hat. Let us consider for one second what this means to Brexit. At every turn, you will have Hammond bearing down on the key Brexiteers within cabinet. At every possible policy change, there will be this iconoclast putting a spanner in the works. One can only conclude that either Theresa May is extremely stupid or naive, or she deliberately put this traitorous Remain zealot into one of the highest posts in government on purpose. Remove this pox immediately if we are to Brexit, otherwise we will be in a state of stasis until people lose their fervour to Brexit. There is also the distinct possibility that stalling Brexit for as long as possible will create an additional feeling of apathy in the people, who will forget and let this go. That is what they hope. Whatever the outcome of this tumultuous affair, one thing is for certain, the new PM is making Brexit promises that may never occur and this is dangerous not only for her position but for the relative calm we are witnessing at the moment. There are still staunch Brexiteers out there, and they never forget. They know who the Remainers are, and these people are seen as Vichy apologists and treacherous traitors, who would no doubt be targets if severe civil unrest were to break out.

Sentiment among many people across the globe is avoid France, especially Paris. Who can blame the tourists for abandoning the city of Paris, and most of the rest of France, for too long the French have been peddling their architecture and mistreating those who visit with overpriced low quality pap. Maybe terrorism is a breath of fresh air for the French who for too long have taken their tourist trade for granted. As the tourist masses desert the streets and boulevards of Paris for fear of being blown up or shot down by some crazy homegrown Algerian or Tunisian Frenchie, one can only feel this is a well deserved reward for the locals. Who likes tourists anyway, however they are an integral part of the French economy? The filthy streets of Paris, now a holding cell for roaming Eastern European gypsy gangs who will cut your throat or hurl a curse at you if you do not contribute to their overflowing purses, or the cafes where waiters spit at you in disgust when you look at the price of a coffee that you need to remortgage your house to purchase, there is nothing left of the Paris of old, the artistic, the love adorned boulevards and poetic cafes. Take a trip into the urine smelling Metro where you are assured to be mugged, stabbed, shot or raped. Maybe a quiet sojourn along the Seine where you are clawed at every step by clamouring migrants, lost, hungry, beaten.

Sadly a mere memory in some poor soul’s bones buried deep under Père Lachaise. Here is your stinking filthy city of Paris within the European Union now a city of merde, an ambling putrefying turd that used to once be the jewel of Europe, flooded to breaking point thanks to socialist policy makers and faux utopian Schengen EU dreams bringing nothing but the worst type of human excrement into its dystopian domain. Paris was spared by Hitler in 1940 when the French surrendered, but to look around in 2016, you realise that the city is now an overpriced, overcrowded concentration camp displaying the machinations of socialist governmental malaise, irresponsibility and downright suicidal insanity. If the French want to kill themselves, let them do it. Maybe the French have a masochistic streak deep in their Gallic consciousness. Your boulevards are now broken, a pollutant seeping over the glistening piss filled streets and pavements, effluent dripping from within and without.

Christianity has a history of hatred, death and purging, and it is no different today. Through technology, the blessed drone bombs and missiles of Christian nations today pummel and desecrate whole villages and towns, killing entire generations of people with one clinical stroke, but it’s okay, because it looks like a video game from 20,000 feet up, and those are not Christians dying. Another religion, certainly less organised than Christianity, is Islam, which although deemed brutal by modern so-called civilised Christians, is simply at an earlier developmental stage than Christianity. Islam today is still at the stage of Christianity during the Spanish Inquisition. When you see ISIS atrocities on the screen, just remember that Christians did far worse in the name of their organised religion and their lord.

According to exam boards, this year the A-level results cannot be altered as easily as previous years and the exams have not been dumbed-down as much. This erroneous change means there will be less photos of lithe young ladies celebrating in the fields of their educational establishments. Exam board spokesman for Fofqual, Matthew Chunder, said: “If we remove the blatant dumbing-down of previous exams where everyone got A grades, this year we made the A-level exams as they should be and were in previous eras, although not as hard.

Although the second amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know. But I’ll tell you what, that will be a horrible day.” Trump later claimed he meant unifying second amendment people to politically block Hillary Clinton from revoking the second amendment, however one must look at the inflection and choice of words during the speech. “..maybe there is” suggesting anything is possible, then “I don’t know” another subtle suggestion of anything, and then the clincher “that would be a horrible day” meaning an ominous negative outcome, i.e. a shooting. It is these subtle yet obvious calls to action that can easily be construed as an endorsement to attack Clinton. There are millions of Americans who will kill to save their right to bear arms, and there are millions of unhinged mentally ill Americans who are not only on medication but have the voracity to hear Trump’s call to action and act on it. Trump’s latest escapade is proof positive that he himself is unhinged, and would readily resort to violence if things do not go his way.

He just wants the power, and when he gets it, he will abuse the power, and ultimately you will suffer, along with the rest of the globe.

It was only a matter of time before Turkey turned away from the EU and Europe, a Christian club which views Islam as some sort of Satanic cult. The recent attacks in Germany, France and Belgium justifying the European phobia of everything Islamic. Strategically, Turkey is a very important part of the globe, and Putin knows this very well as do NATO. Currently the US is using Incirlik military base in the East of the country, but for how long? The recent attempted military coup has caused a further rift in the previous alliance between Turkey and the West. Turkey currently has the second largest army in NATO, but an alliance with Russia would certainly cause a few ripples in the West if they were to lose the all important Turkish East-West bridge. Despite Erdogan and Putin having a fierce bust up over a downed Russian jet, they seem to have patched things up. Russia, increasingly isolated by Western sanctions has found a friend in Turkey who are now negotiating bilateral trade deals to circumnavigate any EU sanctions. In light of this new friendship where does this leave the geopolitical balance? On one side we now have Russia, China, Turkey, Iran and other former Soviet states, on the other side we have America, Canada, Australia, Britain, Israel, Japan and Europe. N. Korea is the joker in the pack and in effect could do anything it wishes if it came to the wire. The globe is restructuring into new areas never before seen, and the balance of power is shifting daily. Of course, we must also factor in Syria, which has destabilised a vast swathe of the Middle East. For Israel, ISIS and their counterparts are not yet a risk simply because ISIS are killing other Muslims in the region. Israel naturally likes this, and is happy to watch for as long as it goes on, however if the so-called Caliphate comes closer to home, things may change. One must understand that the Levant means the territory of Israel as well. The increasingly Islamist Turkey is now taking many steps backwards, erasing any sight of any Kemalist, secularist vision, backwards towards the Ottoman sultanate where Erdogan will rule with impunity. By siding with Russia today, just as the Turks sided with Germany in the First World War, they have played a new hand in the proceedings, and the West does not know how to handle it. If Trump becomes president, he will soon find out that Putin is not his friend, but the Don is too stupid to realise that now. The balance of power could very well be up to Hillary Clinton to complement, and to reign in the testosterone fuelled antics. Our prediction that she will be made president was made on the 14th October 2015, and we still stand by our accurate prophesy that she will be the first female president of the United States of America. For now, say goodbye to Turkey. The Turks have moved back East and won’t come back anytime soon.

Igonumu Akata, 34, a three time bronze medallist was conscious when brought on board but sadly died ten seconds later. The raw sewage pouring into Guanabara Bay where the triathlon, sailing and marathon swimming events are taking place contain so much bacteria that even mild skin contact can mean serious infection. “If you swallow the water you die. It’s really that simple,” said Australian Olympic triathlon athlete, Miles Dunbarr. Unfortunately after making his comment he was found floating in the sewage lifeless. Brazilian Olympic officials have downplayed the concern for the swimming and sailing events by simply ignoring there is a problem of raw sewage. Jaeieo Baiaiaiaiae, said: “In Brazil we are used to swimming in raw sewage. Given time, these athletes will get used to it too. We drink and swim in the water, there is no problem.

These are some of the superhuman feats committed by the Russian athletes, and no one is sure how they did it.

The free movement within the Schengen death zone enables these terrorist cells to travel freely within Europe, and to smuggle deadly weapons without any form of checks at borders. Countries like Kosovo where there are vast amounts of unlicensed guns are vying for EU membership and are currently in the fast-track queue. The Syrian Jihadi cells that have infiltrated Europe through its open door policy are numbered at a moderate 5,000 by EUROPOL, however if one were to include radicalised homegrown Jihadists, and disenfranchised Muslims within the continent, the numbers would be well up in the 100,000s. The well trained terrorists that were invited into the EU merged with migrants. These are battle hardened men and women, trained to blend in, who do not overtly look Islamic, and indulge in alcohol and Western customs. They are triggered by their handlers or news events at any given time, their weapons ready, they can commit attacks within the Schengen zone at any point, and for the European security forces, it is akin to finding a needle in a hay stack. The role of the attacks on Europe encompass many motives, but the main role is to inculcate a feeling of total fear, the second is to make Muslims living in Europe a pariah, to be hated and feared so much that they will escape to the Middle East and the so-called Caliphate. This within Islamic terms is called the Hijra (migration). The French seem to have borne the brunt of the attacks in recent months with the Nice attack and numerous others. The Germans have had their fair share, but these are silenced as much as possible by the authorities. Western women are targeted and raped by Islamists, but the worst part of this horror is that EU officials cover up the news and they are not reported by the press. The only solution is to shut off the Schengen free movement zone completely. All borders must be sealed off if Europe is to be saved from this savagery, however one suspects this will never happen under Merkel and Juncker’s watch. It is almost as if they invited terror into Europe willingly and are encouraging the deaths of EU citizens with their actions. Maybe it is so, maybe that is their wish, for they have now created a climate of utter terror and fear in Europe where Muslims are outcasts and lepers to the predominantly Christian population. If nothing is done soon, there will be all-out war in Europe, civil unrest, and riots where people take it upon themselves to commute justice on those they view as wild savages.

Ten people have been shot and killed, and the indications point to a right wing neo-nazi operation targeting Muslims and Turks in Germany after shouting to onlookers that he was German. Further information reveals the attacker was of German-Iranian descent which suggests he was a provocateur shouting disinformation. Munich Massacre Due to the migratory pressures in the country over the last few years, and the open door policy espoused by Chancellor Merkel, there has been much hatred of migrants in Germany. There is a lot of pressure within Europe right now, on one level there are an estimated 5,000 Jihadi cells who came into the continent freely through the Schengen zone according to EUROPOL, and on the other side, homegrown people who follow right wing nationalistic traits wishing to commit terror atrocities on migrants. UPDATE: German authorities have finally released some information on the attacker who is believed to be an Iranian born in Germany.

These two so-called media establishments are American staples in low quality trigger politics, and in Alex Jones’ case conspiracy provocation. Americans thrive on the lowest common denominator of shouting the news. For a population of predominantly low IQ idiots, this is the height of intelligent discourse. Baiting The well orchestrated attack by the Infowars Jones team was captured on camera and is thoroughly entertaining. In tow were the ladies, on the left Ana Kasparian wearing a red dress, and Infowars favourite Lee Ann Mcadoo. To see them hurling insults at each other certainly added a sensation in the underpants, especially with the sexy Ana and Lee Ann. One would have wished for them to suddenly jump at each other and tear their clothes off in wild abandon. Unfortunately, that never happened. There were no punches thrown although at one point it looked close. Fighting over ratings and viewership is a staple pastime amongst these two rivals, and it is a pity they do not put more time into improving the quality of their shows. Infowars is basically a lowly news aggregator much like the thieving Drudge Report, and the Young Turks is an opinion based aggregator where they comment on any given story mostly garnering YT hits from sex related stories. None of them create their own work. None of them are creative individuals but are senseless egotistical American banal thugs peddling other peoples work and making it their own in a shouty lowly way. A news aggregator, also termed a feed aggregator, feed reader, news reader, RSS reader or simply aggregator, is client software or a web application which aggregates syndicated web content such as online newspapers, blogs, podcasts, and video blogs (vlogs) in one location. When I say thugs, I mean these people are uncouth thieves of other peoples reportage. They take and do not give. Granted they make a very good living out of what they do, because the American people have no standards when it comes to media and accept any old detritus. Sell enough shit, and people eventually like shit. They do not know the difference. Well, the thuggery worked, they got people talking about them, and their ratings may have another boost, and their advertisers will like that.

When it comes to the election, you or your children may very well be called up to the army. When you land in Arabia or some other godforsaken land you will most probably die in a hail of bullets, or have your limbs blown from your body. This is war, and you will be doing it at Trump’s behest,” a military adviser at the Republican party headquarters revealed on Wednesday. Much like George W. Bush, there will be no qualms in entering into wars in the Middle East, with troops on the ground and dead Americans piling up the morgues. Trump’s already had council with Kissinger, and this was a precursor to war in itself. War under Trump is a guaranteed ideal. Such is the support for Trump that many Americans are willing to die for him, and his demagogue status. Dick Monroe, 41, from Chicago, Illinois said at a recent Trump rally: “I want to die for Trump and the flag. It’s an honour to have my legs blown off at the knee, as long as I know I am working for America’s corporate interests abroad.” Who is to say that Trump won’t trigger a full scale nuclear war with N. Korea, Iran, Russia or China, because if he does that, not only will most of America die, but so will most of Western Europe and Australia. The thought of having someone who is trigger happy and unhinged with their finger on the red button is unsavoury, however an all out nuclear war resulting in a nuclear winter for fifty years could be a good thing in the long run, because it will give the earth time to recover from the human polluting pestilence.

Although Katrina was a natural disaster, the response was treated like martial law. The law enforcement troops were going house to house and confiscating firearms from all households. Those who held out, or responded with violence were simply neutralised. It is safe to say the same would occur if martial law were instated in the United States today. Although the constitution of the United States has a second amendment protecting the ownership of firearms, this ruling under martial law falls into a grey area of legality, and in a time of extreme stress, street violence and civil unrest, one of the first priorities would be to relinquish the armaments from the general populace so that peace could be restored. It is to this end that we find ourselves in 2016, in a position of extreme gun violence being meted out onto law enforcement service personnel by rogue citizens. If there is an escalation, for example all 50 states see cop shootings, and there is an increase in general violence, Obama could easily cite a state of emergency and instate martial law then go for the guns. Martial Law in the United States would include: The suspension of the Constitution, probably starting with the first and second amendment. Confiscation of firearms; it has happened and it will happen again. Suspension of Habeas corpus: Imprisonment without due process and without a trial. Travel Restrictions, including road closures and possibly, even quarantine zones. Mandatory Curfews and Mandatory Identification. Automatic search and seizures without a warrant. Once martial law is in place, Obama would also have to suspend the general election of 2016, and he would benefit from a third term in office. This falls in line with a 1961 document calling for all worldwide arms to be handed in: The revolutionary development of modern weapons within a world divided by serious ideological differences has produced a crisis in human history. In order to overcome the danger of nuclear war now confronting mankind, the United States has introduced at the Sixteenth General Assembly of the United Nations a Program for General and Complete Disarmament in a Peaceful World. Americans must get ready for martial law to occur as the augurs do not bode well for the future.'], ['Baton Rouge Cop Killing Spree Escalation in Race War and Destabilisation', 'The New Black Panthers Five white police officers were gunned down in Dallas last week, three were gunned down in Baton Rouge today. Police spokesmen are currently silent as to the details of the shooting, and this is for a very good reason, they have been ordered to stand down from Washington. Whether black officers die in the crossfire is of no consequence to the black shooters, because in their eyes, any black person working for the police has compromised their standing. This is the sort of skewed thought process that is the modus operandi of these attackers. When Obama speaks he blames the police, therefore this gives the attackers carte blanche to commit as many crimes as they want. Baton Rouge’s significance lies in the recent death at the hands of two policemen of a multiple felon, Alton Sterling. One must first understand the agenda at play here, we are at a cross roads within the global forum. Destabilisation of populations within nations either through unfettered mass migration or through racial hatred is a technique utilised for millennia to encourage change. To achieve change within global sectors, the old must be broken down, and the new introduced. It is necessary for change to occur that there is some destruction, but this is put down as collateral damage to achieve the higher global goal. This is why we have hierarchy engineers like George Soros, given free rein over the proceedings, and in Europe, Angela Merkel to spearhead the singular agenda. Soros is funding groups like Black Lives Matter for a very good reason, and there is no doubt that president Obama is fully behind his coercive approach to Change. “Some even believe [the Rockefellers] are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterising my family and me as ‘internationalists’ conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I’m proud of it.” Obama promised Americans Change when he first came onto the scene seemingly out of nowhere, and he still has time to deliver. Whether martial law is introduced is another matter, but for Obama that would be an ideal turn of events, as he could continue his program of Change. The tragic deaths of serving policemen and women is a direct result of Change in America, and the president applauds their sacrifice in the process of change. Obama loves this, he is enjoying every minute of it, and we may see some escalation sooner than later, because America is a seething tinderbox ready to go off at any moment. The fuse has finally been lit but there may still be a few more weeks or months before the real game begins.'], ['Thanks to Theresa May Scotland Will Now Block Article 50', ' It only took a few days for the ineffectual Theresa May to go and hand SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon a major bargaining chip against Brexit. What May has done is she has effectively handed over the onus for Brexit to 62% of Scots, ignoring the majority of the United Kingdom.

Images of coup soldiers surrendering to members of the pro-Erdogan factions is a sad stain on the image of a military broken down by years of cuts by the president, who has emasculated the army of its power. To recapture Turkey’s secularist vision of governance as espoused by the founder of the Turkish republic, Kemal Ataturk, it is imperative that the Islamist Erdogan is removed from office by any means possible, but next time there has to be a complete military coup and not a limited one. Why is a military coup in Turkey necessary? Because Erdogan has closed off all democratic discourse in the media and skewed everything to his propaganda. You cannot have so-called ‘democratic’ elections under authoritarian thug rule such as Erdogan’s non-inclusive regime of fear and totalitarian control where free speech is criminalised. The current despotic Erdogan thus has no mandate as president and is pushing Turkey towards an extremist Islamist regime. One could also argue that this coup attempt was also a well planned fake to bolster Erdogan’s popularity. The way the soldiers surrendered so easily is an indication that this was not a real coup and was a theatrical production organised by Erdogan to not only increase his popularity but to purge and emasculate the Turkish military further. Whatever the reason for the coup, it is a certainty that the Turkish military now looks very weak on the world stage.

It is quite laughable that Erdogan supporters are talking about supporting democracy when their regime does not subscribe to any democratic process with curbs on free speech and totalitarian rule. Islamist president Obama has been on the wire telling the army to stand down and respect Erdogan’s mandate to rule through dictatorial means. It is obvious that the coup attempt was not organised well enough and there was limited unity within the Turkish army for it to be all encompassing.
