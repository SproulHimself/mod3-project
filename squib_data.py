What is it about the letter ‘o’ that is so endearing to the socialists and their dream of turning America into a pseudo-communist socialist state resembling Venezuela? We asked Democrat party official Oona Menendez, the same question. “Why is the letter ‘o’ so important for Democrat politicians, especially regarding elections?” She replied quite succinctly: “Candidates have a greater success with the letter ‘o’ in their name because it breeds familiarity. Like with an ‘o’ people immediately know they’re safe, they are guaranteed socialism or communism. We adopted the significance of ‘o’ after eight years of Barack Obama rule. He was the first big ‘o’ which denoted ‘change’ and he brought in much socialist and Marxist changes to America, which is sadly being eroded by the current president. ‘O’ also stands for the circle, inclusivity, globalism, and collectivism. The main reason though, as I mentioned before, is familiarity, because when a voter is about to tick the box on election day, all they have to look for is where the Os are. If you see an ‘o’ on the first or last name, that’s who you vote for — Democrat. It’s really as simple as that.” We asked her where ‘Hillary’ fits into this? “She doesn’t. Never has, never will.” "], ['Golden Globes Red Carpet Extravaganza Wows Crowds', '“Did you see those golden globes?” an excited reveller asks. “Wow! Those are the most amazing golden globes I’ve seen in years. They deserve first prize,” another excited viewer reveals. Globetastic Globes Globes, globes, golden globes, globulating everywhere. Look left and you see globes, look right and even more globes, the globes are so astounding that it can hurt your neck from looking. There’s something about Red Carpet globes though, because they have a certain je ne sais quoi, a certain class to them, they have been tastefully presented for the world to look at and admire their intrinsic beauty. There is certainly nothing tacky about these globes put on full display for the whole globe to see. “Does it matter if the globes bounce a little or do you think stationary globes are more tasteful?” one commentator asks. “Personally I prefer a delicate balance, maybe a little bounce, but it’s how the light hits the curve of the globes that matter most for me,” the friend answers eagerly. This year’s Golden Globe awards leave no doubt that Hollywood breeds some of the best globes in the world.

Showcasing a masterpiece from renowned painter Modigliani is now deemed as sexual perversion by internet monopoly Google who threatened to disable our ads on the front page. This sort of puritanical nonsense is possibly just another way of punishing the Squib on a constant basis but what is for certain, it is highly illogical and goes against any artistic sensibilities or reason. The Modigliani nudes are world famous and displayed in art galleries worldwide, having said that, it is inconsistent with normal human behaviour to ban a nude painting of a woman because it is an artistic representation of the female form created by an artist. It boggles the mind the amount of censorship that is being doled out on a constant basis on our site, and we can only suppose we are being specifically targeted by Google to thwart every operation we do. We cannot joke, we cannot display art, we cannot write satire, we cannot do anything anymore without being censored by the humourless, anti-art, anti-satire, anti-creativity company called Google. This injustice, is of course not deemed as important by others, and the double standards reek of a witch hunt against satire sites like ours who have a different opinion, and dare to speak freely. Whilst Google allows other sites to display scenes of torture, violence, paedophilia and perverted sexual content, we simply displayed a painting of a Modigliani nude painting and were summarily punished. There is a nefarious air about the level of censorship, that is certainly even more pervasive than was witnessed under Soviet Russia’s era of discontent or any dystopian nightmare scenario dreamed up by George Orwell. As for Modigliani, what would he have said if his nudes were deemed as offensive. Naturally he would have spat in the face of his accusers, and called them a few well chosen names, before leaving in pure disgust. Nu couché (We have not posted a picture of the painting because it is deemed sexually offensive by Google but it can be viewed on the Wikipedia link above) Known in English as Red Nude or Reclining Nude is a 1917 oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani. It is one of his most widely reproduced and exhibited paintings. The painting was sold for a cool $170,405,000 at a Christie’s New York sale on 9 November 2015, a record for a Modigliani painting and placing it high among the most expensive paintings ever sold. The purchaser was the Chinese businessman Liu Yiqian. The painting is one of a famous series of nudes that Modigliani painted in 1917 under the patronage of his Polish dealer Léopold Zborowski. It is believed to have been included in Modigliani’s first and only art show in 1917, at the Galerie Berthe Weill. Christie’s lot notes for their November 2015 sale of the painting observed that this group of nudes by Modigliani served to reaffirm and reinvigorate the nude as a subject of modernist art. All we can say in pure disgust is one day we hope the ghost of Modigliani haunts you Google, and the robotic soulless pieces of detritus you have working for you censoring art and the Daily Squib.'], ['Doesn’t Matter What Year We’re In Still Have to Deal With Same Old Shit', 'If you think another year after the previous year is going to make any difference to the world and your life, stop kidding yourself. We all still live in a surveillance society where every part of our lives and info is dissected, analysed and stored in databases, we still live in a world where idiots run amuck in a state of perpetual outrage demanding less freedom and more censorship, we still live in a world where people believe in supernatural beings that can rise from the dead, walk on water, and turn water into wine. C’mon it’s just another fucking year. You have just passed another year, and now have less time to live on earth, and what an earth this has become, an overcrowded cesspool filled with garbage in the seas, plastic everywhere and pollution reaching every part of the once pure soil, now just a concrete mess clouded by fumes, cow farts, and mountains of human waste. It will certainly be another year in politics, and the lies will continue, as nothing changes, or will ever change. They only give you a few choices for a reason in an election, because both sides are merely different parts of the same coin. The controllers always own both sides, and the reason for ‘elections’ in a ‘democratic’ society is to present a few well-selected fresh faces, otherwise people get tired and riot. The elites in 2019 will most probably be quivering in their boots, and if it gets too bad, they will simply exit to New Zealand or wherever else they have prepared. One major weakness the elites always encounter is numbers — there are more of the Untermensch than them. The stock market, a place where there will be much terror will naturally keep on falling in 2019. Possibly a 40-60% correction is planned, and if you are holding stocks now, you are sadly a fool with no sense whatsoever. In fact, you deserve every bit of what you get because you did not take your money out earlier at the artificially pumped top. We also have Ebola to look forward to in 2019 as it increases its hold on Africa, much to the chagrin of the West, who keep their open borders systems in place, there is no doubt this horrid virus will spread soon enough. Trump, is now looking to lose in 2020. The purge of supporting Trump voices on all social media sites has been so effective that now there is only one voice — the socialist echo chamber. We will have more authoritarianism, we will have more outrage from the permanently outraged, we will have more censorship and the internet will be cleansed of life, of its soul, and in its place the control freak tech puritans will command over your every thought, they will dictate your every move, and they will tell you how to think and act…and if you don’t obey? Then they delete you from everything. Trump himself has been a huge disappointment. Here is a guy who had big plans. He said he would go after the internet censors and he never did. He said he would limit the all encompassing power of the tech monopolies but he never did. He said he would build a wall but never did, he said he would do so many things but he did not. He said he would dump Obamacare, but never did. Trump is now a man running scared, he is a man who has obviously tried to do some things but has been thwarted at every point by the crazed socialists employing guerilla tactics to get what they want. What about Brexit? How will 2019 be for Britain’s supposed exit from the EU..pfffft? More of the same..No Brexit, no hope of Brexit and no one willing to stand up for democracy and the EU Referendum Leave voters. Because May is bolstered by the elite, she is nigh on impossible to get rid of. The May-bot’s batteries will continue on serving her masters, until she completes her job, they then will take the batteries out themselves — no one else can. All in all, 2019 will be another year where those in charge control every facet of our lives. Another miserable year of non-freedom and slavery ahead then. To all our readers..Happy New Year.

She and her coterie of Remainers have effectively condemned the Conservative party to thirty or forty years in the political wilderness away from government. It’s safe to say that every day the current PM is in her post is another nail in the coffin for the Tories at the next General Election. It does not matter if she resigns just before the election as she has promised to do, because she will have already committed the necessary damage. Theresa May has vowed to stay on until her BRINO is pushed through parliament. This act will be the defining moment when the Tories will be abandoned. Already, the Americans have stated that May’s deal means no massive trade deals with the US, thus leaving the UK with nothing. Already, Lord Haw Haw Hammond is again trying to thwart a Clean Brexit by withholding special funds for a No Deal Brexit. Something must be done right now. The UK needs a positive Brexit leader to emphasise the tenets of economic and political freedom away from the EU’s restrictive diktats and authoritarian laws. This is the only way the Conservative party can win back their electorate, otherwise they will suffer for a decades in the political wilderness. '], ['Divided America – The Video That Tells of Civil War Ahead', 'It is quite rare to see a video that is as divisive and ridiculous as the one above. The footage shows the ultimate division America is suffering at the moment. Civil War is Assured On the one side are the Anti-American Communists, and the other are the Nationalist Capitalists, the Democrat Socialists Vs the Conservatives/Libertarians, the SoyBoys Vs the Testosterone, ultimately however it will all be settled by the people who own guns and are trained in using them. “When it kicks off, the SoyBoys will be first to die. The ANTIFA will not survive either, anti-gun democrats will perish, because they just can’t shoot straight even if they did have a gun. The Conservative American Patriot credo is shoot straight, finish the job, then move on to the next target. “Our divided nation now is hanging by a string. All it will take to trigger the Civil War, will be another economic downturn. Most people are living paycheck to paycheck, give ’em three days without and they will turn to animals to survive. The weakest in the link are the socialists, the safespace soyboys, the communist Antifa, the welfare people, basically democrat voters who have now turned so far left, they believe communism is the only answer. These people will be sitting targets because they’re anti gun and anti-American. It’ll be like shooting ducks in a barrel.” In no uncertain terms, the tragedy of America may only be solved through a final civil war to purge the nation. There are many who are wishing on a civil war so badly, they prepare everyday and will have the biggest smile on their faces when it starts. “It’ll be like Christmas, and all the holidays rolled into one. Imagine my pleasure as I pick off the commie liberal triggered fagg*ts off one by one. There will be no campus safespace for these people to run to, there will be no chant they can say to stop the bullets entering their soft bodies. At their last moment, they will wish they learned how to defend themselves, but it will be too late,” one Libertarian Militia member revealed. As for the technorati, what will happen to them in a civil war? The Silicon Valley CEOs and higher ups will flee the country in their jets leaving their underling employees to get slaughtered. There’s little or nothing an algorithm can do whilst an armed well trained right winger points a modded Ar-50 at your cranium. BANG! Expensive brains splattered all over the wall. It is quite ironic that the easily triggered left will be dispatched so easily by triggers in the guns they hate so much.

There can be only one to take us through the mire, through the deceit and lies of Remainers and the EU — Boris Johnson. It is our firm belief that he will step up to the podium in 2019 and take the reins from Theresa May, possibly the worst prime minister Britain has ever had the misfortune to encounter. This woman, stupid or not, has grovelled at the feet of the EU making a mockery of Britain’s divine right to self rule. She has tried to sell us lies over lies, whilst proclaiming she is not lying, and she has been insistent in pushing forth her awful BRINO deal that not even Labour accept. She must resign. In 2019, if the Conservative party want to ever be voted into government ever again, they must dump Theresa May, vi et armis, it must be done, otherwise the neverending impasse will go on for years and years. The yellow vests of Britain will make sure of their discontent if this feckless EU dingleberry, May, stays as PM. Boris Johnson has already proved himself with two successive terms as London mayor, and during that period, the capital flourished, not only economically but with low crime rates as well as celebrating the cultural richness of the city. He must seize the moment mutatis mutandis, and relinquish the crone of her deathly hold which is killing the Conservative party from within. To keep Theresa May as PM, is a certain path for disaster, not only for the country, but her party, as well as the Brexit voted by 52% to Leave on June 23, 2016. There should thus be no ifs or buts — only certainty, and Boris Johnson would give this country a vast boost into the fortuitous opportunities that a real Clean Brexit or a proper deal would deliver to Britain.

When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. 19 Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. 20 But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 21 She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” 22 All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 23 “Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel,” which means, “God is with us.” 24 When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife, 25 but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus. Biblical experts have been studying the facts about the virgin birth of Jesus, from different ancient texts, and have come to the conclusion that Mary was sexually raped by the Holy Ghost i.e. God. “The poor girl was still a virgin and she had no capacity to refuse the seed of God entering her vagina and womb. God had sexual intercourse with Mary one night and she felt violated by a being who did not care for her feelings but did the dirty deed anyway. Selfish God had sex with Mary because he thought she was attractive and he had the power to rape her. “Within the generation we live in today, the #MeToo generation, God would be called a rapist for taking that poor girl and having sex with her without her consent. “It was not only poor Mary who was hard done by, but think of Joseph, he had not yet slept with his childhood sweetheart, when he was cucked at the post by God. Luckily, Joseph took the whole sordid episode in his stride and went along with the violated Mary and her baby Jesus,” Episcopal Dean of St Albrights Christian Research Institute, Jonathan Rembrandt, revealed in a recent study. The Angel of the Lord who appeared after the rape, was possibly a demon looking to have some fun with Mary according to theologians. “The demon who appeared to Mary looked like an angel, but was actually a demon, one of God’s emissaries who tried to justify the rape by saying it was okay to be violated by God’s pulsating phallus. Our scriptures reveal that God has a large member that shoots out Holy Sperm into his fancies, and when he ejaculates the Spirit and the Holy Ghost shoot out with such force that the Holy semen lights up in the darkness, sparkling like a thousand fireworks. What Mary would have felt as she was impregnated without her consent was possibly great confusion, coupled with pain as she was pierced violently by the Holy spear of God. Thrusting, and thrusting until the great Holy climax.” The story of the nativity that has been taught for many years is thus one of sordid rape by an almighty entity that had its way with a little virgin girl, abused her body to sow a supposed Son of God who could perform crazy miracles like walk on water and turn water into wine. “Rape should not be tolerated even if it is God who is committing it. This is a sign of the patriarchal society trying to make sexual assault okay because a God committed it. No, we say it is wrong that God raped a poor little virgin girl and then left without even saying a word to her. Does anyone think how alone and cold she must have felt, to be raped and abandoned in such a way?” #MeToo activist, Hilda Goldsberg, told a group of activists in a new YouTube video. The outrage at Mary’s rape by God is now spreading across the social media sites, with the hashtags #GodRapedMary #MeTooMary #GodRapes. Divine Intervention? The Christian church has been party to much rape in its history, however many Archbishops, and the Catholic Pope deny that God raped Mary. “Yes, he had sexual intercourse with Mary without her permission, but it was for a very good reason. Without impregnating Mary, Jesus would never have existed, even though there is no factual proof he did exist. That is not rape, but divine Godly intervention and fairy tales told to the blindly believing masses over thousands of years. It is the same Christian theory used when a Catholic priest rapes a 9-year-old boy, in the name of God,” the Pope said replying to the voices of outrage spreading across the internet. One Twitter person replied: “So it’s okay to rape a woman if you are a God and want to bring your dumbass son into this earth? Did Mary have a say in this? Her body was violated by the Holy Ghost’s jism in her pussy. Can you even think for a second how sick that is?” The mass debate goes on.'], ['Why Men Are Being Targeted in the West', 'Throughout history, defeating nations/civilisations depended on undermining men and masculinity. Conquering nations requires a multi-tiered approach and targeting the society of any given nation divides its infrastructure and traditions. No doubt, the West celebrates its openness and progressive liberal tenets by pushing the trans queer paedophilia agenda onto their children, however by shifting society to the extreme homosexual angle, they are weakening society militarily. This is why Russia and China are utilising the Western feminist movement as well as the transexual/homosexual push to defeat the West from the inside. Masculinity is now seen as toxic in the West. Men are targeted daily by anti-male media stories, advertisements, and education in schools. By targeting children to question their given gender/sexuality, and encouraging socialist leaning parents to push their children to change their gender, especially from male to female, is an effective method of ‘cutting the balls off’ Western society. Agencies are weaponising socialist celebrations of the LGBT community to weaken the West from the inside. When war comes, there will only be a few real men to fight, the rest will not be compatible or able soldiers, this is the ultimate victory for the West’s opponents. Clandestine operations experts working for Russia are the ones who are encouraging the #MeToo movement, because it destabilises Western society through the breakdown of family units. They encourage feminism and fund feminist activists through the backdoor because to not have a strong masculine West means it is weak and ripe for conquest. These operatives work through many subsidiaries to encourage the Western male to think he is a woman, do the right thing, chop off your meat and two veg at a gender clinic and grow some hormone breasts. “They are disarming the West, seeding disharmony, confusion, and leaving Western men emasculated, castrated by feminism and socialist activists funded directly by the Kremlin and Chinese espionage experts. S-r-s is key to much of the operational activities but is untouchable,” a source revealed. Before any attack, one must prepare, these are the tenets of Sun Tzu, and this is what Russia/China are doing — preparing. Weakening the West by eradicating real men, if there are only weak emasculated men left, once the final push comes through, there will be little or no resistance. Other ways that China particularly is working on to weaken the West is through importation of drugs like Fentanyl, an opiate 50-100 times stronger than heroin, that is decimating whole communities in the United States. The vast pharmaceutical factories in China are working day and night churning out cheap highly addictive drugs to be shipped to America, for a very good reason, disarming the nation from within. The West is being set up, and nobody but a few can see it. The Russians and Chinese want your son emasculated, they want your son to want to think he is a woman and have his balls chopped off, they want your son to be encouraged at nursery school to be taught in homosexuality by socialist teachers under a poster of a smiling Obama. The Western media now is geared completely to denigrating men, to weaken masculinity and to encourage male children to be gender reassigned. Through socialism, Russia and China are working to defeat the West to such a point that in the future, they may just march in and be accepted without a single bullet being fired. When one looks at the societies of Russia and China, there is only strength. Homosexuality and feminism is not accepted, and neither is transgenderism. The onus is on engendering a strong masculine culture, where strength of the male character is valued, because when they are called up for war, they will fight, and not crumble unlike the weak Western male, after decades of targeted emasculation. When the attack comes, the emasculated Western former men will all huddle in their ‘safe spaces’. The masculine Russian and Chinese soldiers will not feel pity or remorse as they plunge their bayonets deep into the simpering soy juiced chemically castrated manjinas huddled around yelping in fear and proclaiming their undying support of feminism. War is coming. It is inevitable because of dwindling finite global resources and increases in population in Third World developing nations. The West may have the technological military advantage however that may not be enough if there are not the numbers to operate with boots on the ground.'], ['Thank You For this Very Special Christmas Card From Our Chinese Fans', 'Amongst the assorted Christmas cards and hate mail we receive yearly, we were particularly enamoured by the wonderful thoughts we received from our fans in China.

From April 2017 to March 2018, it has made a revenue of ₤4.9 billion. British citizens are lucky enough to be eligible to gamble on licensed online platforms almost without restrictions. Providers have to follow KYC/AML policies and customers have to meet the age requirements, but that’s the necessary limitations. Despite the loyal attitude, the main national authority (the United Kingdom Gambling Commission) focuses on toughening the control over the industry. With the emergence of new technologies like blockchain, a new approach to gambling is being actively discussed. A lot of bloggers, like Katie Wager, analyse the future of online casinos, considering possible legislative changes and technical innovations. Let’s discover the situation, trying to see the future prospects of online betting in the UK. Some background The very first online casino was developed and launched by Microgaming in 1994. A software provider CryptoLogic designed the security system and safe money transfers for this platform. The UK citizens were able to use all online casinos before 2005, when the UKGC was established and the first Gambling Act was signed. In 2014, the new version of this law was presented, forcing every operator, including offshore ones, to get British licenses in order to operate in the UK. The current state of affairs Online casinos are allowed in the United Kingdom if they have been licensed by the local Gambling Commission. British customers can hardly enjoy other operators, as payment systems block money transfers to unlicensed platforms. Still, there are enough official websites to choose from. The Gambling Act of 2005 and its amendment of 2014 are the main legal documents which regulate both offline and online gambling. The UKGC monitors the activity of British and foreign casinos, ban or penalize violators, and propose new laws. The community is anxious as the Commission began to tighten restrictions. Recent and upcoming changes Let’s see what changes can be brought by the UKGC’s decisions and what difference can technical progress make. Legal field The beginning of 2018 was troubling. The Commission stated that it would fight unregulated gambling, as well as introduce new requirements for licensed casinos. The announced changes were related to bonuses and terms and conditions, higher transparency of casino rules, and more information about expenses. According to BBC, the UKGC also consulted with the Remote Gambling Association (RGA) on two approaches: Enhancing self-exclusion systems. GAMSTOP is the official national platform which is going to include all online casinos to allow gamblers to control their experience. Additionally, the British may use GambleAware, which is an independent charity organization focused on popularizing responsible gambling. Regulating advertisements. In the cooperation with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), the Commission bans ads which create a fake urgency and trivialize games. Also, the government wants to impose extra fines on casino operators that don’t meet the ASA’s requirements. New rules discussed by the UKGC and the RGA may totally ban ads during live sports events and their translations, excluding horse races. Restrictions will affect online sportsbooks mostly, but casinos should be aware as well. According to the information from iGaming Business, betting companies still have to approve the decision. Moreover, online casinos are under the fire. The Guardian states that in the late November 2018, the UK Gambling Commission penalized four gambling companies because of the failings in anti-money laundering and poor protection from problem gambling. There were huge fines imposed on three companies (Daub Alderney, Casumo, Videoslots), while the fourth one (CZ Holdings) was forced to leave the UK market. At least six more operators are under investigation. Experts say that casinos have to be attentive, as the UKGS is way stricter now than it was a few years ago. It’s not enough to obtain a license but it’s also crucial to meet KYC/AML policies and help gamblers that show addictive behaviour. Tech and innovations Considering these changes, the online gambling industry may move towards decentralization. It’s an extremely competitive sector where casino operators have to provide the best quality and safety to keep their customers loyal. Decentralized systems can fulfill all the demands of modern users who want to be sure about security and transparency of their experience. Blockchain is the most promising innovation that is being implemented by casinos. Blockchain-powered platforms are totally independent of governments and payment systems. Cryptocurrencies are another great feature of blockchain. In refined Bitcoin casinos, gamblers can avoid long expensive transfers with the involvement of third parties. Encryption used for performing crypto transactions is also an important measure of protection. The fate of online casinos in the UK It should be clear that authorities in the UK are going to make online gambling more regulated. Thousands of customers may be upset with this fact: higher fines, banned ads, and runaway operators damage the gambling ecosystem. Thus, new-age systems should enliven the market with innovations like blockchain and crypto. Moreover, as Forbes notes, they can even expand to the land-based gambling facilities, bringing the industry to a new level.'], ['Tech Startup Designs Digital Glasses For Rich People to Edit Out the Poor', 'There’s nothing worse for rich people who have to sometimes pass through areas of a city or countryside only to be confronted with unsightly poor people going about their business or rioting in the streets. Seeing an opening in the high end luxury market, a tech company from Paris, France has come up with digital eyewear that simply edits out undesirables and the Untermensch as well as ugly poverty ridden surroundings. “Why see slums when you can look across Lake Geneva?” is the catchy tagline for the digital glasses. “The user specifies what sort of people that the digital AI system will edit out, and through face and gait recognition as well as what type of clothes the person you are looking at is wearing, the system will simply erase them from your view so as not to add offence to your sensibilities. Whether it is the crack addled street scum, welfare recipients, ethnics, tramps, migrants, gypsies or working class people, you will never have to look upon them ever again,” Pierre Martineaux, startup CEO, for eFFACER revealed on Wednesday. The glasses are so sophisticated that they even have sensitive smell sensors embedded on the frame, and can can detect a poor person from over 100 yards. “Poor people have a certain smell, and it’s certainly not Givenchy or Pierre Cardin. This is the first line of defence. Then the image of the person is run across an extensive database, and erased before the wearer notices. Our sophisticated database engine also recognises whether the image is a rich person dressing down, for example ‘shabby chic’ a la pop starlets and actors. These people are not erased from view, because they may be simply champagne socialist celebrities and such,” Martineaux added. The company is so confident of their product that they recently tested the glasses at a Gilets Jaunes violent protest. “I approached the Champs Elysees and I could hear some faint activity, rocks, shouting and sirens through my headphones but nothing bothersome. The glasses however edited out every single person from the riot as they were successfully identified as poor people. All I could see was the boulevard on a warm Parisian summer’s day. It was truly amazing, because I had my headphones on as well and was listening to some delightful adagios from Mozart, so the experience was not unsettling at all,” project engineer, Eric Dugasse revealed. Unfortunately, he was later hit on the head with a pavement stone during the exercise and now has permanent brain damage. Despite small setbacks, the company still plans to go ahead with the first phase of production. The glasses will not come cheap either, as they will only be accessible to the market they are aimed at — the super rich. They will retail at a yearly subscription price of 1.4 million euros. The reasoning behind the subscription model is that the tech is constantly updated, which works to the advantage of the wearer as well as funding further research into the product. “Why upset your day by seeing offensive things like poor people and migrants? We are also designing a new machine learning system that not only edits out poor people and other undesirables, but replaces them with AI depictions of rich people as designated by the wearer. This is not only revolutionary, but will ensure that the rich are not tortured daily by the crass vulgar displays of poverty that are so prevalent in this day and age.” Endorsements for the product have already come in from high, French President Emmanuel Macron has ordered a pair, as has EU President, Jean Claude Juncker. All members of the European Commission will be given complementary pairs funded by EU taxpayers of course.

Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has already tabled the motion at an emergency parliamentary session shortly after Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn was called in to apologise. The word ‘stupid’ will however not be banned, because it is an adequate description of many who attend the House, and the words they speak could be easily described as ‘stupid’. “It is impossible in this day and age to have such a thing as a ‘stupid w*man’. All wom*n have IQs well above Albert Einstein and he was a measly man not worthy of stupidity. I hereby declare that no w*man can be described as stupid. They are all very intelligent creatures above the level of men. We can still say ‘stupid man’, that is perfectly acceptable because men are now classed as third rate citizens. Furthermore, with regards to Theresa May, I would like to reiterate the point that she is not a ‘stupid w*man’ but a ‘stupid cunt of the highest order'”, one member of the parliamentary committee in charge of stupidity in the House said before being heckled."], ['NetEnt Casinos – Live Versions Expanded New Territory', 'I n November 2018, one of the world’s leading software providers NetEnt (Net Entertainment) has launched the full live casino package in Denmark. Now, customers can enjoy all the presented games with real dealers thanks to the brand of Mr Green and its gambling platforms. This is the first entry to the Danish market for the company which provides live games to a lot of customers in several countries. It has solid positions in Europe in general – Net Entertainment casinos rating for UK citizens made by AllHighRollerCasinos.com shows that the brand is especially valued among high rollers. Why NetEnt Live is worth mentioning? How it can boost the gambling experience? What are the most noteworthy innovations and achievements of the provider? Read on to get answers. NetEnt Live features Basically, live casino stands for games with real croupiers broadcasted in real time from a studio. NetEnt’s live games are streamed from specially equipped studios in Malta. Affiliate casino operators use their own websites to integrate these streams and allow gamblers to enjoy this experience. On live platforms, the company provides: Roulette Blackjack Common Draw Blackjack Additionally, the provider has designed the global environment called Exclusive Virtual Casino or EVC. Thanks to it, users can switch between tables without closing the interface. Casino operators can order this system; Mr Green is the first big brand to do this. Apart from games, there is a brand-new automatic system for operators called NetEnt Live Rewards. It allows creating personalized promotional offers, rewarding players with cash or bonuses, and catering products for gamblers. Live Casino is available for both desktop and mobile players on 25 languages. It also supports 25 currencies worldwide. With Chroma Key technique that allows modifying background, casinos can promote their own brands with logos. Live games for new markets In 2017-2018, NetEnt has launched its games in several countries. Most of the projects are limited to betting systems and, sometimes, slots. Only a few partners have enough resources to host live casino, as it remains highly innovative and demanding. Moreover, NetEnt constantly develops new live features to attract more attention to the product. Geographical expansion As we’ve mentioned, entering the Denmark market is the latest milestone of the NetEnt live department. After the launch of the EVC system, Mr Green and Unibet ordered it and presented their own virtual platforms. The former operator provided NetEnt’s live games, including Roulette and two types of Blackjack, to Danish citizens. Mr Green’s Live Beyond Live final system now features a set of tables, seamless streaming quality, professional croupiers, and personalized support for Denmark. Both representatives of NetEnt and Mr Green claimed that such cooperation should benefit brands, expanding their audiences. Henrik Fagerlund from NetEnt says that ‘Mr Green is a perfect partner with a strong presence in Denmark’. Antoine Bonello responds that NetEnt Live can enhance Mr Green’s proposition in Denmark. It’s too early to evaluate results but they may be impressive. In August 2018, NetEnt also has expanded its influence in the UK after making an agreement with William Hill which should provide live games to local customers. This partnership between one of the biggest live casino operators and the company with an innovative approach to live games promises to be fruitful. More than a year ago NetEnt signed a deal with Mozzart to launch both traditional online games and Live Casino in Serbia. The local operator now hosts dozens of entertainments, including Live Roulette and Live Blackjack. NetEnt’s officials stated that they are happy to ‘strengthen positions on regulated markets’ and pleased that Serbian players can enjoy the most popular titles. Apart from focusing on the expansion of NetEnt Live, the provider partnered with a number of casino operators in the following counties: Canada, Lithuania, Norway, Czech Republic, and others. It’s clear the NetEnt is improving its products and spreads its influence. Technical innovations From the beginning of 2018, the provider introduced three new updates to Live Casino. The first one – Live Beyond Live – was developed in cooperation with already mentioned Mr Green and presented during ICE Totally Gaming. Gamblers can enjoy the multi-table system, extra view angles with additional cameras, and smooth interface. Earlier, NetEnt launched other noteworthy innovations: Sports Betting Widget: it allows gambling in live casino games and betting on sports events simultaneously Live Sports Roulette: during this tournament dedicated to the World Cup, players were able to check live results with dealers’ comments NetEnt’s hegemony Considering the active expansion of NetEnt, we can say that the company tries to take a lead among casino software providers. Its main competitors, Microgaming and Playtech, enter new markets a bit slower. With impressive features of NetEnt Live, this brand can attract more customers and casino operators. The partnership with Mr Green shows that NetEnt is on its way to hegemony.'], ['Orderly Clean Brexit is Perfectly Manageable', 'The only way Theresa May can ever vindicate her previous inaction and misguided action, is through an orderly Clean Brexit or as it is labelled by the perpetually afraid — a No Deal Brexit. The government should therefore give businesses more clarity on the processes of a managed Clean Brexit to allay their fears. The rest of the world has been trading perfectly well under WTO rules, as does Britain right now. The Project Fearmongers are a bunch of hysterical Remoaners who are only afraid that they will be cut off from their mother’s teat momentarily, i.e. mother Brussels, who gives them their monthly stipends and backhanders. This is why the government must step up their preparations with extra budgets available for all business in Britain, and tax reductions, as well as tax breaks taken from the £39 Billion which would otherwise have been thrown away into the EU black hole. Theresa May must present a positive view of a Clean Brexit, and all this Millennium Bug scaremongering must be stopped. Anna Soubry who has threatened to resign would be another welcome effect of a Clean Brexit. The contemptuous witch should have been fired and thrown from the party in disgrace a long time ago anyway. The Clean Brexit should become central policy immediately, and it should be embraced as a wonderful opportunity to escape the EU cleanly. If Theresa May does not adhere to this Clean Brexit then she should be removed and a real implementation of the Brexit must be conducted by a Brexiteer. This is the only opportunity for Britain to exit the EU with some dignity and Theresa May to vindicate herself.'], ['Desperate Theresa May Doing the Brussels Rounds Again', 'To see a desperate Theresa May in Brussels today was a sad sight to behold. What has happened to this once great, proud nation to see the Prime Minister grovelling on her knees to Brussels bureaucrats? No dignity left “I felt some vomit coming up when I saw Theresa May with this desperate forlorn look on her face. She was completely alone whilst the EU bosses all looked at her with pity and derision. Her begging face was out. I just wanted to go over to her and kick her in the shins really hard. It was a disgusting, repulsive view of someone so profoundly weak that it brought on nausea. Thatcher would never have done this. She would have told the lot of them to ‘eff off!’,” a stunned British onlooker revealed. Is the PM stupid? Anyone with any logic would have known that her Brexit in Name Only would never be accepted by parliament because it goes against every concept that was voted for on June 23, 2016 at the EU Referendum. The blame has to also lie with the idiots in charge of the Conservative party who put a Remainer in charge of Brexit. She did not have her heart in it, she exuded a negative vibe about the whole process, then tried to pass through a blatant capitulation to the EU through the backdoor. “I have no sympathy for that thing they call Theresa May. It is an automaton, a programmed robot that just keeps knocking its head against a brick wall. Someone, or something needs to take the fucking batteries out of that thing because it’s making an almighty mockery of Britain,” another shocked observer revealed. The sight of Mrs May dragging the country through the dirt in such a pitiful manner is so sickening, one almost expects her to go to the EU Commission car park and start bukkake dogging sessions with the Brussels bureaucrats all queueing up to get serviced. For god’s sake woman…just resign, at least keep some dignity.'], ['Espionage Experts: Google China Search Engine Data Will Go Straight to CIA/NSA', 'Clandestine operations in China are imperative for the acquisition of data about the Chinese population and communist hierarchy, and this is one of the reasons why Google has been enlisted by Western intelligence agencies to do the dirty work of indirectly siphoning off huge amounts of data from the closed off firewall of China. “You can’t get a better opportunity than this to glean crucial information about the communist Chinese than the Google search engine. The data will go directly to our intelligence agencies and will be utilised for future military operations. We do have some understanding about how the Chinese operate, however we need a more direct line, and thanks to Google, they stepped up,” one former member of the intelligence community revealed. The secretive Chinese have effectively cut off their communist nation from the rest of the world with regards to the internet, and this is why there has to be a cleaner more agreeable method of information acquisition. Human rights activists have recently voiced their concerns about Google venturing into the Chinese market due to the brutal nature of the communist regime in dealing with those who are not accepted by the communist party ideology, however this is no concern to Google or intelligence agencies. They just see the people who are arrested and brutally tortured by the Chinese authorities as collateral damage in a bigger game. The data acquired will be of huge interest especially when it comes to the financial markets, global economics, and internal communist operations, as well as general information about the Chinese population as a whole. China has been conducting blatant acts of stealing classified information from the West for some time, so this time, Google will be doing the honours for the West. What is certain, is that the information which will be received from China with Operation Dragonfly will serve the West well. Another certainty, which has now been confirmed as a definite is that Google is a defacto arm of the United States military intelligence cloaked in a civilian disguise, that is now flapping in the wind, uncovered for all to see.'], ['Every Vote For Theresa May is a Vote For Her Chequers BRINO Deal', 'Jean Claude Juncker was emphatic that the current BRINO deal will never be renegotiated by Brussels. Theresa May faffing around sniffing bottoms in Brussels will not achieve anything, and everyone knows it. End of story. Therefore, every Conservative MP who votes to keep on Theresa May in the no confidence vote is effectively voting for a BRINO (Brexit In Name Only) deal which is the only thing May is committed to producing. There are some claims that May is saying she will step down before a general election, but only after she puts through her BRINO deal. This is not acceptable to Leave voters, and is a blatant betrayal. Those MPs who thus vote to support May are not fit for purpose and have effectively betrayed every Leave voter who voted on June 23, 2016. Sir Bernard Jenkins, is definitely voting to oust May, and he has been one of the only logical people speaking about this no confidence vote. In these circumstances, it should be known that many will feel extremely angry by Theresa May staying on just so she can push through her Brexit capitulation through parliament. The only way therefore to get rid of Theresa May, as the Conservatives are not fit to do so, is through a general election. If anyone has any ideas about how to force a general election please leave a comment below. We suspect it may have something to do with the DUP. They just need to withdraw their support for May’s government et voila..'], ['Gift That Keeps Giving: Labour Hoping the Tories Keep May', 'On the eve of the no confidence vote on Theresa May’s non-leadership of the Tory party, and her complete muck up of the Brexit, there are some who are hoping that she stays in and plods along for another election — cue the Labour party. Jeremy Corbyn’s party are keeping their fingers crossed that the idiots who support May carry on doing so, because she is the passport to a Labour win at the next General election. “We know for sure that real Brexiteers will never vote Tory again if they keep Theresa May, and they will never support her BRINO deal. That’s votes lost for the Tories right there, 17.4 million odd. Labour will win the election because the Tories have effectively abandoned their grassroots voters,” a Labour election campaigner revealed today. After May’s roasting at the hands of Corbyn today at PMQ’s there is no doubt who has the upper hand in parliament and it’s not Theresa May, who cannot even command any sort of relevant leadership. The Tories will be stupid to keep May, but Labour is counting on the stupidity and greed of the Conservatives, no doubt many have been bribed with promises of kushy seats in the House of Lords for May’s support. It does not matter a jot whether May stays on and promises to go after Brexit, but before an election. The evil deed will have been done, the Brexit betrayal will have been committed, and for real Brexiteers this is enough. They will never vote Tory ever again. Every day, every hour, every second that May is kept on, Labour grows stronger, because they know now that THEY will have the votes at the next election and not the Tories led by an old boot, not fit for the knackers yard.'], ['Anything is Better Than Theresa May and Philip Hammond', 'Please we petition all sane MPs within the Conservative party to oust this Brussels automaton Theresa May. Forty eight letters of no confidence in dodgy Theresa May’s leadership have been placed with the 1922 Committee now, and the vote will hopefully be positive this evening. The PM’s nonsense Project Fear about delaying Brexit because of a new leader is absolute shit. What the PM is proposing is not a Brexit anyway, and will tie the UK with EU indefinitely. Anything is better than what she is proposing. Anything! Even if Brexit is delayed, at least it will be a real Brexit by a Brexiteer and not Theresa May’s BRINO. May has said that she is now having to stay in London tonight and deal with a vote of no confidence (boo hoo) instead of negotiating with the EU, when Juncker has definitely put down the clause that there is NO MORE NEGOTIATION. We need a leader who is positive about Britain’s exit from the EU, who believes in Brexit and does not capitulate to Brussels at every opportunity. Once she is ousted, there has to be a comprehensive clean-out of Remainers from the Cabinet and other positions within power. This is the only way we will have Brexit, and there is no other way. The DS questioned the efficacy of having Remainers in charge of Brexit in 2016, and we knew then that it would never work. Thank the gods of parliament and democracy that MPs are finally waking up to what the Daily Squib knew all along. Lord Haw Haw Hammond as the Chancellor of the Exchequer has actively thwarted Brexit at every turn. There has to be a change before Brexit can be realised properly, and if there is no change, then the problems will persist on and on until the Conservative party is completely decimated, and the nation is stuck with a Brexit deal which is not Brexit but an indefinite imprisonment to Brussels. We need action NOW more than ever to oust Theresa May who has completely squandered her position and betrayed the British people. May is a festering pustule bubbling on the flaming arse of Beelzebub and needs to be lanced immediately for the good of the country and parliament. Kick Theresa May and Philip Hammond into the sewers where they belong. If Theresa May is not thrown out, no Leave voter will ever vote Conservative again.

Despite being the chief sales person on the lot, useless Theresa hasn’t been able to sell anything for over two years. Her bosses in Brussels, Belgium are thinking of canning her, with a replacement soon. “Yes, yes, I got a call from my bosses in Europe yesterday. They said I’m fucking useless and should be sent to the glue factory. I said, watch this! I will sell all the cars on the lot by 12 tomorrow!” a defiant artful dodger Theresa recalled. Naturally, Dodgy Theresa chickened out of her dare, and was last seen cowering under her desk in the office. Oh dear, where has it all gone wrong for Dodgy Theresa? What a nightmare.

Theresa May’s makeup artist has also had trouble covering up the cowardly PM, who would rather see the country and her party destroyed than resign. “She came in for her morning fit up, and as I brushed the makeup on her, my brush was stained yellow. It also stank of the trousers of an old tramp. I plastered another even thicker layer of makeup but the urine smell did not come off and her complexion was even more yellowy.” It’s also funny because Theresa “Dodgy” May is also known as a liar, and her nose seems to be growing as well. “Theresa May is now an unhonourable lying piece of cowardly shit.

You need to stay clear of all the unethical casinos in order to protect your personal and financial information from getting leaked over the internet. Casinos Need to Support Customers It is not just the betting houses, but there are even certain gamblers who carry out unethical practices and spoil the reputation and the name of the betting site. The best of the best gambling sites uphold the laws and the rules and regulations to run their business. They do everything in their might to protect the interests of their genuine customers. The laws apply to each and everybody who becomes a member of the casino and is not limited to a certain group of people. If a betting site imposes a law that is confined to just a certain group of players, then this is not a reputable option followed by the gaming house. Such gambling centres should not be allowed to operate and they must be opposed. There is no way a business can charge two different amounts for the same products on different customers. A gaming club is in this business to make profits and no one is against this. But, it has to make profits in the right manner and without cheating the general public or their customers.

The wrong practices are a serious troublemaker to all the concerned areas of the gaming house. There need to be proper and thought through measures to be implemented to get over the immoral doings that are causing problems to the casino industry. What Falls Under the Unethical Practices Sphere? The following are some of the important factors that fall under the ambit of dishonourable practices in an online gambling industry. The resorting to deception, cheating, and dishonesty standards by the unruly elements; Misrepresentation of the facts with the aim to create confusion and suspicion in the minds of genuine customers; Emotional blackmail and manipulation of the people to make the most out of their helplessness; The desire to gain massive profits and to achieve it with all kinds of illegal ways; Creating false reports and documents to show increased profits; Trying to avoid the penalties and paying out the compensations for the wrong deeds and acts; Not being transparent enough and trying to dodge the government investigations; Gaining access to the privacy of the members to gain their personal and financial information. How to Correct Unethical Behavior? Bring in the Business Ethics Culture There needs to be a business ethics that should be formulated by the casino so that the workers are fully aware of the rules of the trade and try to practice them. The people must be given the freedom and liberty to raise their voice if they see any wrong practices happening around. There need to be seminars conducted for the employees about ethical business practices followed. Compliance Officers It is important for the compliance officers to be in place to check out any unruly behaviours happening in the casino world. They should be having strict vigil against unruly elements joining as the workers or customers. They should always be on the lookout for any abuse, deception, cheating, or bribery taking place. Encouragement for Ethical Members The people who work to practice the casino ethical standards must be recognized and also be awarded for their good deeds.

Trying to get the PM to make a decision is like rubbing a forty day old pollock until all the fish juice squirts out all over the carpet, imagine the smell of it.” After much wrangling, it has been officially confirmed Theresa May will have her mass debate on telly, this Saturday. She will be mass debating with herself and trying to convince herself that her Brexit In Name Only bad deal is what people want. “The PM firmly believes in repetition. For example, if you say a lie to people long enough, not only do they start to believe your lies, but eventually you will believe your own lies. That is the way the cookie crumbles,” the PM’s aide added.

In the past two decades, considerable results have been achieved in the fight for human rights, especially regarding LGBT members and women. However, it seems within the last several years the once easy-going West has reverted back to the puritanical Middle Ages, with new censorious Soviet-style restrictions appearing thus silencing the voices of the minority and adults in general. Tumblr is a place where people create blogs, find friends, and share everything one could even think of. Discussions of LGBT representation in media, explicit fan fiction and fan-art, sharing of nude pictures — Tumblr allowed the exploration of one’s sexuality. It was common to see posts like “small breasts are absolutely valid” or “check wellhello com review here and let’s meet”, with people eliminating such concepts as body shaming and sex work/dating sites negativity. Now, though, everything has sadly changed. Tumblr’s New Policy Tumblr has around 450 million blogs. As of December 17, the following rules become active. · No explicit and graphic content, including photos, gifs, and fan-art; · Especially no sex-related content; · Especially no ‘female-presenting nipples’. Needless to say, such news shocked every single user of the once liberty driven site. The last category has become particularly horrific yet hilarious, with people exchanging pics ten times more actively, letting Tumblr staff guess which nipples could be recognized as female. Apparently, Tumblr officially recognizes male nipples as less sexy than those of females, but what about transgenders or people with breast scars who want to discuss their stories? Tumblr claims that banning explicit content is to safeguard “children”, which is strange indeed since children are not supposed to be on Tumblr in the first place. So, how does Tumblr intend to achieve its new policy? Tumblr’s Actual New Policy As of now, Tumblr has managed to do the following: · Flagged every second non-explicit post related to LGBT, including text posts, all of which are supposed to be allowed; · Flagged works of art and sculptures with and without nudity; · Flagged bread; · Flagged its own post with a new policy announcement. Hysterical laughter is the only reaction Tumblr users are now experiencing. There is much speculation discussing the fact that Tumblr was kicked off Apple and wants to return there, that it wants to secure the support of family-friendly organizations, etc. Which is the truth? No one knows. However, it is undoubtedly an act of censorship that targets LGBT members and women in particular. Tumblr’s new anti-sex policy is proving to be anti-LGBT and anti-female, and millions of users, including minorities and sex workers, are risking losing their safe harbor. In an attempt to eliminate healthy sexual self-expression, Tumblr even accidentally banned itself. It would have been funny if it wasn’t so disastrous, especially considering the century we live in.'], ['Screw the John Lewis Christmas Ad – Alternative Released', 'The run-up to Christmas in the UK always features some sappy loved up £25 million budgeted John Lewis advert plastered all over the media with paid shills oohing and aahing over its gratuitous saccharine banality as the featured song naturally goes to Number one on the singles chart.

Male bosses are advising the limit of risk, and this includes no dinner with female colleagues, never sit next to them on flights, do not talk to them in a room alone, book a hotel room on another floor, never hire them unless extremely necessary. “Essentially big finance has cut off all ties with women, simply because they are too high risk. You not only have risk of saying the wrong thing by accident and being #MeToo pilloried, or having a woman accuse you of sexual misconduct, or the added risk for the business with women becoming pregnant adding on huge costs like maternity leave. The list is too long to mention here, but we just don’t hire them anymore. It’s as simple as that,” one CEO at a top trading firm in Wall Street revealed. Even talking to a woman at work is now risky because of the #MeToo era, anything a man says can be construed as sexist, offensive or demeaning. “We have one who works on our floor. We just nod at her or grunt a hello and walk past. You just can’t say anything else because of the lawsuits and Twitter,” a scared male employee revealed. The risk limiting is also now extending to the White House, where Vice President Mike Pence recently revealed that he avoids dining with women other than his wife. “The golden rule from now on is never speak to a female colleague at work, avoid them at all costs. If you have to speak to a woman and it is necessary for the job, you must have at least four witnesses present, and all the doors open, even if it is meant to be a private matter. The best way to avoid all of the hassle is not hiring women, and we are adopting this rule as number one. We just can’t function properly with that kind of threat hanging over us every day, so we limit the risk by deleting the risk, you know what I mean?” another Wall Street boss revealed.

This is pure sexism. The only female present is the mother of Jesus who was impregnated by a patriarchal God, a masculine one,” #MeToo supporter, Loretta Atmos, told the Huffington Post. Another #MeToo activist went as far as saying that “Christmas is evil because all male babies should be aborted at birth. Why celebrate another male born into this world?” The #MeToo anger has been spreading across Twitter with similar sentiment, and the hashtag #BanXmasMeToo is trending. There is further outrage at the tradition of the festive holiday, for example, the Christmas tree symbolises an erect phallus and is meant to celebrate fertility in the new equinox. When people are decorating their Christmas trees, they are effectively dangling baubles over a large erect penis. Definitely not a #MeToo woman One twitter #MeToo respondent was so disgusted by Christmas trees she wants them all banned as well. “We should not only ban Xmas because it is a patriarchal sexist holiday, but those awful phallic Xmas trees. Everything about it is masculine. Plus think about all those trees being chopped down each year. We could save whole forests.”'], ['How the American Social Justice Warrior Princess Changed the Windsors', 'Things have no doubt changed for the Windsors. Sadly for many of the members, it’s all very PC, and hunting has been given the shunt, as well as other little traditional regal institutions of the crown like blatant jocular racism. Our emissaries ensconced deep in the firm tell us wondrous stories of how the changes have somewhat irked the established members. “If one wants to shout at the television after a particular news report resplendent with savages running amuck and that sort of thing, one has to be careful. The PC Princess as we call her has ears as sensitive as Prince Philip’s bowel movements,” a source revealed. Hunting is now out of the question when Meghan is around, and that goes for the Blood Rite, as well. “It’s not only the hunting that has gone, but consider this fact, pretty much every object or statue around the palaces are from Britain’s illustrious history of conquest and imperial superiority. Wherever Meghan goes, she now asks where this piece or that piece was stolen from, and how many indigenous people died for the relinquishment of said objects. On a visit to the Tower of London, Meghan was so angered at the sight of the diamonds on the regent’s crown she declared that they should be sold off to feed the slum children of India. “One must also feel a deep pity for Prince Harry, here is a lad who is used to dipping one’s wick into an assortment of different pots served up to him on a platter, a man of varied taste. Needless to say, now that Meghan is preggers the fun is over, and Harry has been left with his wick in the wind, doomed to only one flavour for the rest of the marriage.” Certainly things have changed amongst the Windsors, as social meetings are now more subdued. The Duke of Edinburgh has effectively been silenced completely, and is not permitted a single word now. Instead he sits silently in the corner mumbling to himself. If he does dare to utter a word or even a sentence, he is immediately re-silenced with some hor d’oeuvres served up by his personal butler and another dose of opiates. There have been some rumours about some shenanigans between the two duchesses, Meghan and Kate. “One of them is honed, well trained in royal protocol and docile, the other is a wild unknown import who is used to saying and getting what she wants and is obviously stifled by royal protocol and British sensibilities. It’s like placing a peasant sugar cane farmer from Papua New Guinea amongst aristocrats, the culture shock is too great.

Brexiteers have been vilified, labelled as extremists, called dumb, and completely denounced, ignored from the EU negotiations or debate. Remainer, Theresa May, and her adjutant, Oily Robbins, a staunch remainer, have effectively hijacked the whole Brexit process, and have proposed a deal which leaves the UK completely vulnerable to the EU, and ties it in to the Customs Union, indefinitely thus relinquishing any way of conducting global trade deals. The remainer PM, has even gone through two ‘Brexit secretaries’ a job which is nothing more than a glorified tea boy, with no power or role in the process of exiting the EU. The EU referendum, was the largest democratic vote ever held in the UK, and 52% voted to Leave the EU. We are not dumb, we knew very well what this entailed. It meant leaving the EU Customs Union, the ECJ, the CAP, the CFP, the Single Market and all the other EU constructs designed to imprison countries, whilst making Brussels and the few favoured nations running the show richer. It’s as simple as that. If we had a Brexiteer as PM, we would have been out of the EU two years ago, and forging trade deals now. The Irish backstop is something created by remainers and the EU to thwart a full exit. It makes no logical sense to have a remainer as PM in charge of Brexit, or all the other remainers who are pulling their remainer strings in positions of power. There is no other recourse but to instate a Brexit leader immediately. Theresa May, is a duplicitous liar, who has been shown to have used corrupt processes to thwart Brexit at every turn, and is now even stopping the publication of her Attorney General’s legal advice, which even Tony Blair did not do before the Iraq war was erroneously pushed through parliament. Now is the time to act, because there is plenty of evidence of wrongdoing on Theresa May’s part, she must be impeached, given a vote of no confidence and summarily booted from office. Do it now.

Amongst the clattering of stones and canisters, a solitary man in a yellow jacket is playing the Marseillaise, but is cut short as a phalanx of riot troops converge on his position. It is the noise that hits you at first, the whistles, the explosions, the clattering, the shouts of the injured, the French sirens, an all encompassing sound of rage that fills the boulevards. One can only imagine the terror of the residents looking out of their plush apartments at the mayhem and destruction below. It is close to Christmas in Paris, and the trees have been decorated with lights on the Champs-Élysées, their juxtaposition of violence and protest leaves an uneasy duality. The decorations for Christmas, this time are burning barricades, exploding vehicles, and cowering policemen. The water cannons move in further, and the protesters are forced away from one particular zone, as other protesters erupt from a different zone. It all seems futile for the outnumbered police, as they simply move from one place to another not achieving anything at all. These riots, they say, will go on and on, until the government capitulates its position and reduces tax on fuel. The revenue lost from tourism must be enormous, as well as the shops and restaurants which have been forced to close.

Along with Brown Brothers Harriman, and UBC, Hitler’s rise to power was assured. “If it was not for George Herbert Bush who spawned Dubya, that PNAC stated Pearl Harbor moment on September 11, which led to the 2nd Gulf War, would never have happened.

The wars achieved a remarkable statistic of over 2 million Muslims killed or displaced from their homes.

You Britisher swine will always serve us, we are your masters, we have the power, Britisher Schweinhund,” Colonel Selmayr told Bild magazine. Disgrace to democracy Britain is certainly receiving a just punishment for the folly of having Remainers put in charge of Brexit. The fault of this firmly falls on the hierarchy of the Conservative party who put Theresa May and her Remainer Cabinet in charge. “What do you think was going to happen? You put a Remainer in charge of Brexit. That’s like putting a florist in charge of an abattoir or a dustman in charge of a banking consortium to manage major international deals. It ain’t gonna happen,” one man with some sense quipped. Theresa May is also charged with deliberately denying the publication of her attorney general’s legal advice to parliament, because it reveals the fact that the UK cannot extricate itself from EU control and power after her so-called Brexit. She is thus deliberately misleading parliament and is committing a crime of treason against the UK. Treacherous May even refused an offered trade deal from Trump’s USA a few months ago. The dishonest PM has also been caught giving a Knighthood to one of her cronies to gain their support for her deal.

If the French had to deal with the amount of tax rises we British have to deal with, there would be nothing left by now but rubble. French President, Emmanuel Macron, has simply scoffed at the protests and remains safely ensconced in his palace. “Qu’ils mangent de la brioche,” the president exclaims from his boudoir, to accentuate the point about how out of touch he is with the peasants. The struggling Gilets Jaunes peasants, especially in expensive Paris, are living in literal poverty anyway, so to increase taxes on fuel to such a level not only hurts their means of transport, but increases the prices of daily goods to be transported to the shops, thus pushing prices up on everything as a result.

The trend is obvious: marketing expenditure is skyrocketing. In fact, according to a report by strategic consultancy Regulus Partners titled Gambling Advertising and Marketing Spend, it rose by 56% from 2014 to 2017. Today, there are numerous online gambling providers operating in the UK. For more information on the most popular ones, check out the fastest payout online casinos. Online promotion of such operators uses direct, social media and affiliate marketing methods. The former includes banners and paid search. Other advertising channels are television, sponsorship, and offline channels, such as print media and billboards. The Breakdown Online marketing accounts for 80% of the total gambling marketing expenditure, with direct methods amounting to almost half (48%) of it. While direct internet marketing doubled over the three-year period, social media advertising more than tripled – rising from £42m in 2014 to £149m three years later. Affiliate marketing, which includes tipsters, websites and publications that generate new business for a commission, was the slowest, climbing from £282m to £301m, which is 20% of the overall marketing spend. As a lion’s share of marketing budgets is now spent online, television advertising is lagging behind, despite the growth from £155m to £234m. The amounts spent on sponsorship were still relatively moderate despite their doubling: advertising on football shirts, horse racing, and other events totaled £60m in 2017. It is important to note that as detailed marketing cost breakdown is commercially confidential, it is impossible to obtain definitive figures. The consultancy used audited accounts of the largest listed operators, as well as figures for offshore and private companies. The estimates, therefore, are sufficiently credible. Most importantly, they demonstrate the relative scope of online marketing. The Consequences The mentioned figures raise serious ethical issues. The Gambling Commission has recently reported that as much as 59% of children aged 11-16 have been exposed to the ads on social networks. For television commercials, the proportion is even greater – 66%. According to Marc Etches, CEO of GambleAware, a leading UK charity, children following gambling operators on social media are three times more likely to spend money on gambling. “Compared to other potentially harmful activities, the rate of gambling in the past week among young people is higher than the rates of drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes and taking illegal drugs”. This data points to the urgent need to perceive gambling as a threat to children and a public health issue. Social networks and websites must recognize their moral obligation to protect the youngest and the most susceptible ones. It is thus imperative to increase public awareness of the potential dangers posed by the activity.'], ['Theresa May to Release Book on ‘How to Bargain’', 'Shameful PM Theresa May is to release a book giving tips on how to bargain, Number 10 Downing Street has revealed. “If the price of the apple is 35 pence, this is when I give the shopkeeper £2.60,” a quote from one of the lessons shows.

The man may say to me “That’ll be £40,000 please!” and I will answer “Here you go!” and hand over the money. Plus you have to show always that you’re really excited and fixated on the thing you want to buy, so the seller can raise the price as much as he wants.” One section of Theresa May’s 3 page manual even advises people on how to negotiate with the EU. “They come into the room and say that they want this, this and that. I then capitulate to everything they ask without a word. After all they are my master, and I am a mere servant. Also, before leaving the room of any EU official, you must bow down and touch the ground with your nose, then back out the door facing them. Don’t forget to leave £39 billion behind before you leave, or your masters will become very angry. “One must always make sure when bargaining that you let it be known that you will not walk away even if the deal is so bad that the person you are bargaining with is literally laughing in your face. It is better to be a shameful coward with no backbone or guts than to cause any trouble by actually standing up for yourself or actually bargaining,” Mrs May notes on page 2.

Europe needs a tougher approach on immigration in order to curb the growing threat of right-wing populists, Hillary Clinton said, calling on EU leaders to show their electorates that they can no longer “provide refuge and support.” “I think Europe needs to get a handle on migration because that is what lit the flame,” Clinton said in an interview with the Guardian published Thursday. Reading a quote from the 2011 Daily Squib article entitled “How Long Before the EU Concentration Camp Chimneys Start Churning Smoke Again?” confirms Clinton’s diagnosis in 2018. We saw the warning signs, before anyone else did. Even in the UK, there are increasing reports of racially charged assaults and outbursts by seemingly ‘normal white people’, but these are mere symptoms of the Hegelian dialectic where the problem of increased immigration was allowed and encouraged to happen by successive governments for a very good reason — to create discord, disharmony, hatred and fear amongst the indigenous populations. An immigration open door policy was allowed to occur so as to create a problem of overcrowding in urban areas; destruction of indigenous culture, valuable resources being used up, intolerance and racism to flourish. “First you create the problem, then you wait for the people to cry out, then you move in with a solution that enslaves the people even further than they already are,” Gunther Mauser, a German politician told Die Welt newspaper. We would go as far as saying that the engineered migration problem is not only part of the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan, but also a ploy to bring out Europe’s ultimate inherent racism. The socialists of Europe are just as racist as the other side, however they veil their racism better. Socialists need someone to point their finger at, so they can rally the troops during elections, it gives them vigour and impetus. We witnessed this recently during the American midterm elections, where the American socialists and communists effectively censored and dehumanised their opposition and won many seats in Congress from the Republicans. Anyone who cares about their own home, security or family is demonised and labelled a “racist” or a “populist” by the socialists.

The medical treatment is the latest trend amongst Germans, who sadly are devoid of any form of humour and live their lives mainly in a technical manner. Professor Arnold Weinglauss, who has performed the procedure numerous times, will officiate the process, which will take three hours of surgery time. “The procedure is rather complex, and one slip can induce a deeper state of catatonic depression which is the normal state of the Chancellor. We will infuse the ventral striatum within the temporal lobe area, and invigorate the region by injecting a dimorphic mixture of nanobots specifically designed to stimulate the humour centres.” Chancellor Merkel, like most Germans is unfortunately afflicted with an extremely morose sensibility, however after the operation she may be able to smile slightly or even say a joke. “It will take some time with such a serious case as Frau Merkel, however we may see some effects in less than two months. Instead of that milk curdling gaze, she may laugh a little. This may take her by surprise, however, and a counsellor will monitor her behaviour. We have had cases where the patient has been so surprised to crack a joke that they fell into utter depression afterwards because of their confusion. We are not however expecting Merkel to suddenly take the podium and act like a stand-up comedian, even with our technological prowess, that is a near impossibility with such a serious case as the Chancellor.” Merkel will undergo the humour injection operation in January.'], ['Jeremy Corbyn May Be Only Way to Leave EU Properly', "Theresa May’s Brexit In Name Only is a sure chance that many voters will now turn to Jeremy Corbyn and his party.

There’s no get out clause either. In plain English it’s not a Brexit but a shameful capitulation to the EU. That’s why I’m voting for Corbyn next election and you should too. No one will trust the Tories ever again because they have been completely duplicitous and dishonest with their core voters. Never again, thanks to Theresa May will any of us vote Tory again. Better to vote for Labour and Jeremy Corbyn,” a former Conservative voter revealed today. Thousands of former Conservative voters, and Lib Dems are now opting for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party. Along with the youth vote, the extra numbers will get Corbyn into Number 10, Downing Street and Theresa May out. “It’s now the only way to get rid of her. Jeremy Corbyn is the only way, because the Tories can’t do it, despite her blatantly taunting Brexiteers with her lies.

Thanks to Theresa May's Brexit Betrayal Will You Now Vote For Jeremy Corbyn? Yes No View Results Jeremy Corbyn’s main reason for leaving the EU will be to bolster a firm communist state in Britain without the interference of the EU, and its ideals. “Corbyn sees the EU as a meddling money sucker. It would be better to leave the EU completely so that Britain could keep its money to spend on socialist issues, the NHS, welfare, and education. Also, Corbyn will need tonnes of money for the many nationalisations he has planned. This will take a lot of capital, especially the rail networks, nationalising utilities, and building millions of new council houses across the UK,” Labour’s chief spokesman, Mike Oxlong, told the New Statesman. No one will vote conservative for another thirty to forty years after this debacle, and quite rightly so. Britain will thus be resigned to its fate as a pseudo-communist island replete with comrades in arms marching up and down Red Trafalgar Square.

It’s all very Black Mirror but without the enclosed claustrophobic stories, these glimpses into the future are more diary like, snippets of scenarios. Let us say an Adrian Mole of 2097. Quite astutely, the author sees the future rise of China, and we can be assured this will certainly become a reality with the Chinese Armada skirmishing with the Royal Navy across the high seas, or conducting bombing runs on Bognor Regis every other Tuesday. In 2079, John Lewis is still in Oxford Street. This came as a great fucking relief, because one can’t imagine that particular London shopping district without John Lewis. Let us hope that Hamleys is still around too, albeit selling hoverboards for the kiddies. In turn, this is a great piece of literature whizzing from one place to another, and giving the reader little insights into the possible future, some comedic, some obviously horrific in a satirical sense. Not sure if the Singularity happens at all in the duration of time in the book, but the worst part seems to be the realisation that Celebrity Big Brother still exists in 2094. Isn’t all out nuclear devastation from Russia and China preferable to CBB still being around in the future? One can only imagine. People still play cricket in 2100, and probably still munch on cucumber sandwiches during the breaks in play. This was refreshing to read like a good cuppa. Anti-ageing treatments on the NHS are obligatory by 2128? Surely that will bankrupt the already aching NHS 2.0? Well, the government ministers do debate the question, and thankfully come to their answer. Things get very interesting by 2157, especially amongst some of the Plutocrats, who are rather keen on the Ancient Egyptian civilisation. In 2060 mohawk-haired government advisers stalk the halls of Number 10 Downing Street, by that time, Tarzan Heseltine is a bag of bones deep in the ground somewhere, no doubt cursing someone who has outdone him in the hair department. This book will certainly have you turning the pages to see what happens next, isn’t that the job of a good novelist? Guy Portman no doubt seems to have fulfilled the desired effect on the reader, as you really have to turn the next page to see what wonders await, a compendium of technological prowess amongst the backdrop of human stupidity. The miniscule details, the jumping in from one language to another, and the mixing of ancient with modern adds duality to an intelligent meal of a read. Well worth the purchase. Plonk it into your collection, and you will not be disappointed by this satirical tome from an indulgent innovative author. http://guyportman.com/ Purchase your copy now: Goodreads Amazon US Amazon UK Kobo UK Barnes & Noble '], ['Experts: Brexit Thwarted By Deranged Dictator PM, Parliament Bureaucracy and Corrupt EU', 'All the people wanted when they voted for Brexit was to get out of the EU, and its institutions. Alas, since the EU referendum Brexit has become more of a distant mirage, and unattainable dream simply because of the establishment putting obstacles in the way of leaving the EU, and the EU putting obstacles in the way as well. Any decision now regarding Brexit is meticulously broken down and voted out, and the sad thing is, if it comes to the ideal Brexit, i.e. a Clean Brexit, that too will be voted down by the Remoaners. Against Brexit is the PM, the majority of the Remoaner Cabinet, handpicked by Remoaner PM Theresa May, the Treasury headed by Remoaner Lord Haw Haw Hammond, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, a Canadian, and 95% of the House of Lords, as well as most of the so-called Conservative party hierarchy. Other groups outside of parliament are the Soros Open Society, who fund people like Gina Miller to thwart Brexit in the High Court at any possible time, and other business people who are all on the EU gravy train and are fighting for their expense accounts. The media is now mostly anti-Brexit, with even the Daily Mail siding with Remoaners and Brussels, this is possibly due to the exit of Paul Dacre, and the instatement of Remoaner Editor Geordie Greig. The BBC, which received £5 million just before the EU referendum from the EU is naturally pro-EU, and the CBI where Theresa May spoke the other day on the benefits of her BRINO deal is completely pro-EU as it receives millions in EU money every year. As for the civil service, they are all completely pro-EU, and they control everything from behind the scenes, a la Olly Robbins. Suffice to say, the likelihood of a Brexit occurring anytime soon is about zero, and the far flung future is no better, the promises will drag on and on for years to come until everyone is so bored of it all they just elect to stay in the EU. Ultimately, this is the plan the EU and controllers in government hope for. They want people to be so jaded by the whole bureaucratic affair that they say fuck it, and leave Britain in the EU. The whole sordid Brexit affair is extremely tiresome and sickening, because it brings to light that there is little or no democracy in Britain left. We are ultimately chained now to a corrupt system of government, and the EU’s totalitarian pseudo-communist diktats permanently and there is nothing anyone can do about it.

It’s also a great chance to buy up those Christmas presents that will wow your family members and friends. The key to finding Black Friday deals is to search online, and also attend the shops where the deals happen. If you are happy to spend four days queuing for a cut price toaster that was made in China and is just a piece of flimsy metal that will break in four weeks, then that is up to you. Our plan this year was to list as many amazing deals as we could find for our readers so you too can be first in queue and snap these amazing offers up before the rest of the suckers do. 5 Black Friday Deals That You Must Have 1 -Britlax Toaster – £7.99 from Murreys – This amazing toaster toasts your toast in less than 20 minutes, and is guaranteed to break only after 3 weeks of usage. It also burns toast to a crisp if you move the notch above 0. 2 – Xuenho Toaster – £4.99 from Tulleys – This toaster is amazing. It can toast four pieces of toast in under one minute, but you should disable your smoke alarm before using it as the flames can reach the ceiling. All in all a good toaster, but please do not put your face over it while it is in operation. Guaranteed to explode after one weeks usage. No money back or replacement guaranteed. 3 – Burnio Toaster – £12.99 from Sullies – This toaster, as the name suggests burns everything to a crisp within a five metre radius. It’s definitely top of the range Chinese engineering and will reduce your kitchen to a smoking wreck just in time for Christmas. Why not throw in the turkey for some fast cooking? 4 – LingWao Toaster – £2.99 – If you pick one of these up at a Black Friday sale, you will be the lucky owner of a magical piece of equipment. It’s cheap and dangerous. Our toaster which was sent for testing had some wires hanging out the back. When we plugged the appliance in to the mains, the whole area became live with electricity and fried our office pet. Luckily little Jimmy the Sausage dog survived the ordeal but sort of looks like a seared hot dog now. 5 – JinWong Toaster – £24.99 from Argo – This is top of the range mate. It’s like hitting the fucking jackpot four times over and still having a prize foisted on to you. I mean this toaster talks to you, it’s a new smart toaster, which analyses how many toast you want in the morning then it tells you when they are done, in Chinese. It’s a great way in learning a language while you toast. The only drawback is that the toaster is so efficient that it basically disintegrates the toast to nothing. We tried putting it on the lowest setting but still no luck.'], ['Techniques Horror Movies Use to Scare Us', 'S ome people love the rush they get from watching horror films, while others completely hate it and can’t understand why anyone would choose to watch something with the intention of scaring themselves! Even though watching a horror movie the viewer knows it is isn’t real, the best horror films are still able to leave you on the edge of your seat, ready to scream, but how are they able to have this effect? When watching a film usually the motor regions of the brain are temporarily shut down, but in the case of many horror films the stimuli are so strong that it can overcome the inhibition to the motor system. The viewer then automatically jumps or screams, as an automatic reaction designed to both protect us and warn others of danger. So much so that this actually happens before we even process what has actually caused the fear. Horror films have been scaring viewers for more than a century, but it is only recently that neuroscience has been able to be used to explain the reaction in the brain whilst watching a horror. Many different elements are used within horror films with the purpose of frightening the viewer. The fear of death, which for most is the ultimate fear is often used, both in reality and psychologically. So that, the majority of horrors audiences will see at least one character reach their death. This is heightened even further, the more vile and evil the character is, like Gollum in The Hobbit franchise. The dark is often a childhood fear of many and is used within horror films to incite fear, by making the viewer wonder what is hiding or lurking in the shadows and ready to jump out. The best movies of this genre always contain elements of suspense within them. Suspense involves the creation of anticipation that something bad is about to occur, but not knowing when. Some of the most shocking scenes within horror films will create a mass of suspension, which will then end in something happening on the screen that will really shock the viewer, for example one of the main characters getting killed, usually in some gruesome manner. Music is also used often to create anticipation and fear within horror movies and it can be used to create moods and elicit emotions. It helps to amplify the feelings of shock and suspense within the viewer. Currently, horror devotees tend to agree that it is the Japanese who have discovered the right formula when it comes to horror. This breed of horror films has become really popular worldwide, but why are they so scary? Japanese horror movies really tend to focus on the psychological and suspense aspects within horror and will often heavily feature paranormal activity and also themes of exorcism, shamanism and possession. Some historical elements of Kaidan, which is Japanese folklore is also often found within these films, many of them containing stories of ghosts. It is clear to see that the elements of Japanese horror are now finding their way over to the Western movie making world, by looking at films such as Paranormal Activity, which features many of the same fear inducing traits that are familiar within Japanese horror. Therefore, we can see that many factors are utilised in the making of any horror film. The scariest and more often than not, the most successful movies, will find the perfect combination to keep audiences in a state of constant fear and anxiety. This mental state is, believe it or not, exactly what audiences are looking for and no doubt they will demand even more as time goes on.'], ['All British Police to Finally Be Armed', 'The British police have been putting their lives at risk for too long, and thankfully this is all about to change as all police officers will finally be allowed to carry firearms, and join their colleagues from every other country in the world. The amount and level of crime has increased to such a level, that it was ridiculous to suppose that police officers would attend crimes in progress armed with nothing other than a puny truncheon and a pair of handcuffs. “Criminals these days carry an assortment of weapons from machetes to AK-47s. You would get a policeman arriving at a crime scene, and he would be faced with thugs running at him armed to the teeth while he gets his little truncheon out and is tasked in taking down these criminals. If the policeman gets away alive or is not seriously injured, then it’s a miracle,” Superintendent DCI Kevin Plodder, told the BBC. The new government white paper outlining the arming of every policeman in Britain will be published in full next week. There will also be a 60,000 increase in officers by 2020, and a budget increase of 75%. Routine stop and search will be conducted in areas where crime is prevalent. “A policeman or woman has a right to defend themselves from heavily armed criminals. This is why our police will now be trained and armed in firearms,” a member of the policy team announced on Tuesday. What kind of firearms will the police now be trained and armed with? Each squad car will be equipped with an assortment of weapons including pump action shotguns, automatic weapons and tasers. All police will routinely be equipped with handguns and tasers whilst on patrol. “The level of crime is at such a level at the moment that our rules of engagement will be upgraded to shoot to kill. Our officers will also be protected from prosecution and most cases will be accepted by the courts as just proportionate action,” police spokesman, Andy Grenville, added. Recent polling has shown that arming all police officers in Britain has received a positive response with 85% approval rating.'], ['Barren Witch Threatens to Cancel Brexit and Fracture Conservative Party', 'Not content with betraying the nation with a contractual debacle that will tie Britain into certain slavery for eternity with the EU, this barren witch with a coal black womb, does not have much heart either, as it is black as well. Sitting in her den, her cauldron boils over with many insidious ingredients, as she stirs the vast pot bubbling with vicious plans for the future. “My masters, I have vowed treachery upon those in Britain, they must be punished, my masters tell me every day, it must be done at any cost. There are many now trying to stop me seeing through their plan, and my masters have given me the green light to achieve the goal of imprisoning Britain forever in the EU. Whether tis to ruin the Conservative party, that is no consequence to me or my masters, because we only care for one thing. Yes-s-s, to push through the plan, to sign the contract, as it was scribed by my masters, I have to get this through.

There is nothing they can do.” The witch rubs her belly, for she wishes to punish the whole country for her state of barrenness. “All these vile people in Britain who can have children. Not I, my blackened diseased womb, is the same as Merkel’s, for this we are sisters in inequity, in shameful detestation of everything that is good, like the right to self-determination, sovereignty and national borders, where the little kiddies can run around happy in their playgrounds. We can only look at those little pattering feet and feel disdain, avarice and extreme jealousy.” As the Number 10 cat saunters into the den where the witch is working, it suddenly realises its mistake and tries to make a run for it. “Not too fast me dearie, hmm, the cauldron needs some more ingredients. Cat, cat, felix, fluffy one, into the cauldron of doom you go, with the people of Britain, and all things that are good like freedom, liberty, and sovereignty, to your doom, doom you go, just like my blackened womb, to doom you must go!

What Theresa May is touting is a total surrender to the EU, and she wants us to pay £39 billion of taxpayers money for the pleasure. EMERGENCY BROADCAST We need urgency right now. This is no time to mince about and twiddle thumbs, or to think about it, we need action right now. The Conservative MPs who are enabling Theresa May in her surrender betrayal are disgusting sycophants and remainers. twitter The others currently in the Cabinet must seriously think about what they are doing. They are enabling a surrender to the EU proposed by Michel Barnier and Theresa May. If you do not find the right path and resign from May’s Cabinet, you are complicit in her treachery. Conservative MPs must back the no confidence vote, because Theresa May is the problem, and if she does not go, and go soon, there will be more turmoil for many years to come. Her proposal will condemn Britain to thirty years of riots and political turmoil, with no one ever trusting the Tories ever again. If you are a Conservative MP, you are implored to do the right thing and support May’s ousting. For the good of the country and its future, it is imperative that she is either made to resign or forcibly resigned from her post. There is no hope for Theresa May, and we have asserted numerous times that she is the Chequers deal and it is her, but no one listened then, even though MPs are waking up now to her complicit methods of pushing her surrender through parliament. This is an emergency, and MPs must act now, decisively with haste, but it must be measured haste of course, as timing counts as well. There is no way that something as bad as this deal should ever be allowed anywhere near a signature. Time is running out. Please read this and act now. For the good of the country, you can make a difference in parliament if you are a Conservative MP who cares about their country. Please spread these words far and wide, as every tick of the clock is a moment lost in action to save the nation. Write to your MP, call their offices, go and see them at your constituency surgeries.

This is a time of great crisis for the Prime Minister, who is trying to sell her ‘Brexit’ deal to the parliament and country. DS: Prime minister May, thank you kindly for granting us access, especially in this time of turmoil and political chaos. TM: I am firmly committed to conducting the Brexit the people voted for, to take the UK out of the customs union, to control migration, to take the UK out of the Common Agricultural Policy, to take the UK out of the EU fisheries policy and to take back control. DS: How can we get out of the customs union when there is a clause tying the UK to the EU permanently? Even your attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, warned you and the cabinet that this will be nigh on impossible to get out of, and even if the UK tries to get out of it, it will take decades of lawyers working day and night at huge cost to the country. Not only that, you have conceded to pay the EU £39 billion for the pleasure of imprisonment and nothing else to show for it. TM: I am firmly committed to conducting the Brexit the people voted for, to take the UK out of the customs union, to control migration, to take the UK out of the Common Agricultural Policy, to take the UK out of the EU fisheries policy and to take back control. DS. Do you think it was right for a Remainer to try to conduct a Brexit? Most of the Cabinet are Remainers, and most of the civil service, Treasury and Bank of England. Your deal looks like it is a remain document as opposed to a Brexit document. In other words, everything is geared towards appeasing the EU with massive capitulations making the UK into a vassal state with no say or get out clause. TM: I am firmly committed to conducting the Brexit the people voted for, to take the UK out of the customs union, to control migration, to take the UK out of the Common Agricultural Policy, to take the UK out of the EU fisheries policy and to take back control.

TM: I am firmly committed to conducting the Brexit the people voted for, to take the UK out of the customs union, to control migration, to take the UK out of the Common Agricultural Policy, to take the UK out of the EU fisheries policy and to take back control. DS: You keep saying that but the document says otherwise. Why do you say one thing when you are presenting something completely different? This document keeps the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. Why are you lying? Are you going to give a free vote on this draft to parliament Mrs May? Please answer the questions, Mrs May.

There were strong contenders in each category and it was always hard to choose one clear winner.” The new Responsibility Grand Prix for cause-related work went to “Price On Our Lives” from McCann Worldgroup in New York. The campaign allowed the students of America to protest against gun violence with a potent symbol: the price of their lives as calculated by the amount of money the NRA donates to politicians, divided by the total number of students. The price tag amounted to little more than a dollar. Commenting on the win – and its Network of the Year prize – Rob Reilly, Global Creative Chairman, McCann Worldgroup, said, “Winning awards is never the motivation, but rather, the by-product of doing the right thing for our client’s business. A big shout out to all of the MWG employees for always going for it, never giving up and making our brand partners wildly successful.” The Alternative Grand Prix, also a new prize, went to Publicis Italy and Diesel for a campaign that struck back against counterfeit fashion. Diesel created its own rip-off brand, “DEISEL”, and sold it in a shabby New York pop-up store during fashion week, before revealing that, yes, the clothes really were authentic – only the label was wrong. Plus, this was a limited edition. Cue lines around the block and lots of buzz about Diesel. The Digital Grand Prix was won by Rothco/Accenture Interactive for “JFK Unsilenced”, a project for The Times. It used digital technology to recreate the speech John F. Kennedy would have given at the Dallas Trade Mart had he not been killed by an assassin’s bullet on November 22 1963. The almost perfect voice of JFK, giving the speech he was never able to make, gives listeners chills. Jill Byrne, Director of Marketing for Rothco, said: “It’s a huge endorsement for us that the journalists working for marketing and communications magazines around the world have recognised our work for The Times and awarded it the prestigious Grand Prix.” DDB Germany won the Print Grand Prix with “Highlight the Remarkable”. The campaign for Stabilo highlighter pens literally “highlighted” talented women who had been neglected by history and forced to stand in the shadow of their male counterparts. In a joint statement the agency commented: “The whole team is excited that this campaign has been recognised with an honor at Epica Awards! It truly adds a new facet to highlighting the remarkable.” The Design Grand Prix went to 72andSunny, which created a new and dynamic identity for the multifaceted city of L.A. on behalf of the Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles. 72andSunny’s Executive Strategy Director and Partner Kelly Schoeffel said: “It was an honor to brand Los Angeles in the midst of a creative renaissance – from tech to entertainment to manufacturing. Our first-ever civic identity system celebrates the diverse community while supporting and funding local creativity.” The Film Grand Prix was won by Shiseido in-house for its quirky and poetic film “The Party Bus”, which combines animation, special effects and drama to tell a contemporary fairy tale. The 3D animation required close to 2000 stop motion shots. Shiseido creative director Masato Kosukegawa said: “I would like to thank Shou Yanagisawa, the director, and all the artists who worked with us, for their precise and inspired craft. ‘The Party Bus’ was made to expand Shiseido’s reach to young people. We thought a lot about what we could do with makeup in this confused and divided world. In the end we arrived at the concept that makeup can be courageous, and that doing your makeup your own way brings self-confidence. This led us to touch on the topic of LGBT. In Japanese culture there is a strong conservative tendency, and stories of LGBT are not commonly told yet. I think this film was probably the first work by a major Japanese company to address LGBT in an advertisement.” Humour Category In the humour category, the Daily Squib’s favourite choice won the gold award, “Smart House” by entrant TRY, which displayed a hilarious satire on modern technology and its good/bad points. Another highlight was the short but straight to the point ad “Shit in Space” suffice to say, there is something quite endearing about Norwegian humour and the creatives, producers at TRY agency in Norway. Runners up in the humour section were: “Comic Relief Safety Video” by 2AM, “safer snaxxx” by BBDO Group Germany, “Alexa Loses Her Voice” by Lucky Generals, “Now or Never” by FP7/CAI. Entrants & Entries by Country This year Epica received 4020 entries from 69 countries, a 20% increase on the previous year despite difficult market conditions. This was driven by the return of the Publicis Groupe networks, plus an enthusiastic response from Germany and Latin America. Indeed, the highest number of entries came from Germany, followed by the United States and France. New countries this year included Iran and Morocco. In terms of networks, BBDO and McCann Worldgroup were particularly well represented. Results by Country France was top in the country rankings with 53 awards including 12 golds.

Instead of a Brexit minister, I have decided to appoint a Remain minister, because it falls more in line with my BRINO Chequers deal. No, I will not take anymore comments thank you,” the PM hurriedly announced this morning. What will the Remain minister’s duties involve? Olly Robbins, kindly explained the role of the Remain minister to waiting press outside Number 10 Downing Street. “As chief Remain operative, we had no qualms about ignoring our previous Brexit ministers, so we are dispensing with the whole Brexit thing anyway due to our remain stance and the cleverly worded dossier we presented to the people that explains why we will remain in the EU. Brexit actually means Remain. Just thought I might reiterate that point. For every step out of the EU, we are assuring the UK makes four steps back into the EU.” The Remain Minister, will start work immediately, first by simply reading Theresa May’s BRINO deal and explaining to reporters why leaving the EU means remaining in the EU."], ['Perpetually Offended Person Offended by the Concept of Being Offended', 'Perpetually offended Social Justice Warrior, and keen activist in all socialist matters, ranging from LGBTQP affairs, feminism, no borders, soviet ideology, marxism, and the ideal communist state, Hugh Mungus, is in a state of perpetual offence. “I wake up in the morning and the first thing I hear are the words, ‘good morning’ and I shout to my roommate that this is a form of racist linguistic capitalist imperialist sexist white-male created offensive greeting that assumes it is a good morning in our Western capitalist bourgeois society when there are people in Africa NOT having a good morning. They are having a shit morning because they live in a corrugated iron shack and have to walk for five hours to fill a bucket full of dirty muddy water to fucking drink from.” Mr. Mungus, who attends Berkeley college in California is so outraged that he now deems all society, biology and science offensive as well as the concept of being offended as offensive. “I am outraged and offended at offence. It is offensive and hateful to be in this perpetual state and the concept of being offended is offending. Being offended in itself is an offensive stance to the state of offence and offending. Being offended is no doubt in my mind a creation of the capitalist racist sexist system which imprisons people to be offended and I suspect they created offence in the first place.

There is no danger. The ship BRINO may be taking on gallons of freezing water through the torn hull, the violins are still playing, and I am still dancing on the deck, even though we are now lopping port side at 35 degrees.” As for the crew of the ship that are still onboard BRINO, they are vehemently promised by Captain May that there is nothing to fear, and that everything is fine. “Mrs May told us that it’s ok and even though I am now hanging from a flagpole and the ship is making these rather unsavoury gurgling noises as the water is pushing through, I am committed to believing Captain May that there is nothing to worry about..Aaaaargh!

David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, must be so bored of having to announce a deal being made every 48 hrs for the last few months. “I get the call from Olly Robbins, to make another 48 hrs announcement, then after another 48 hrs passes, I get another call to do the same thing. Frankly, I’m getting rather bored of it. This BRINO stage managed fiasco really is smarting. I have better things to do.” Of course, we all know the plan is one of stalling things for as long as possible, in order to push the “Brexit In Name Only” Chequers deal through parliament as a matter of urgency towards the end of some deadline made by Brussels. Hopefully the good ol’ boys and gals will be there to vote the fucker down as soon as it finally rears its ugly head. Coincidentally 48 hrs was a great movie from 1982 starring Nick Nolte, and a young Eddie Murphy. The bit that really sticks in the memory is the moment Eddie is in his jail cell singing Roxanne by the Police. This was truly a wonderful cinematic and comedic scene. Nolte plays a hard edged cop who enlists Murphy, a convict, to find a killer in less than 48 hours, or it’s jail time for Reggie. At the time, it was a typical cliche black and white buddy movie, with the usual love and hate politics. Great film.

No half measures, no half foot in half out, none of that. The EU referendum result was promised that it would be solidly binding and respected by parliament, and not meddled with. This promise was of course made because the Remain side was projected to win. When the result was Leave, this was obviously a different story and democracy flew out of the window. It seems there is no belief anymore in Britain, a land that has much illustrious historic value, and has been the bastion of adversity for thousands of years. We’re not fucking surrender monkeys that roll over like the others, those wet farts who initially disagreed to an EU referendum question, but were ordered by their EU masters to have another one until they got the answer Brussels wanted. (France, Ireland, Netherlands) Clean No Deal Brexit Britain’s future will be one of great riches and sovereign greatness, if it leaves without a deal. Its people and parliamentarians can hold their heads up high, and they can forge their own trade deals, they can fish in their own waters, they can make their own laws once again. We must embrace freedom. Yes, it is going to be tough, but better to live one day as a lion than 100 as a sheep. We must move forward, clean no deal Brexit. Let the EU dwaddle on that one, let them eat their own rotten cake, for it is they who have reneged, backstabbed, and wriggled like worms in the so-called ‘negotiations’. It is time to stand up. Now!'], ['Women and Children Will Be Pushed to Front When Migrant Caravan Reaches US Border', 'The technique the organisers of the migrant caravan will utilise to offset any military presence at the U.S. border will be to push the women and children to the front, almost as a human shield, and to also display them to the world’s press who will be filming them. This method is utilised as a means to shame the military, because they will be facing off to thousands of women and children. This will also engender feelings of sadness amongst viewers and pity. The Mexican authorities have repeatedly promised the migrant caravan people homes, benefits, schooling and safety, but none of the participants of the caravan have taken up the offer, even though many are claiming they are pursuing safety and asylum. They instead only talk about going to America. The organisers of the migrant caravan, are funded by many organisations, mostly socialist and communist, inadvertently funded by US taxpayers through shell charity organisations, and those linked to George Soros. In Guatemala, 11 Cuban nationals were detained, and many in the caravan are from far flung spots like Bangladesh, Congo and other Asian countries. It is a certainty that the migrant caravan was planned over a year ago. This can be ascertained by the immense logistical operation, where food and rest stops along the route have all been meticulously laid out. Transport, and even payment to the participants of the caravan to continue their journey, some paid over $1,000 each for the trek by leftist groups. These poor people are effectively pawns of the leftist groups who are manipulating them purely as a political agenda to undermine Donald Trump and America. This despicable act is a human tragedy and the organisations who have been implicit in organising this should have their US affiliates shut down by the Trump organisation and their funds seized. One cannot be sure of the response by the Trump administration when the migrant caravan hits the border, but if he backs down he will be viewed as weak, if he acts aggressively, then he will cause outrage amongst the leftists and communists within the United States. This is a very fine tightrope the president now finds himself on. What will he do to get out of this calamity foisted on him and the country? How will all of this end? Could this topple Trump and his bid for 2020 reelection? Break out the popcorn and Schlitz and keep watching.'], ['Think Tank: Britain Must Invigorate Military Budget and Bring in Compulsory Draft', 'Time is running out, according to a global think tank, Strategic Universal Coalition Kraft, who determine that the acceleration of military might in Russia and China is outclassing anything that is happening in the West. “Russia recently unveiled a hypersonic ‘glider’ called Avangard, active under the Red Banner Missile Division, which is based in the south Urals. This terrifying weapon travels at 20 at times the speed of sound, is invulnerable to any air defences, and can strike a target anywhere on Earth ‘like a meteorite’, according to Vladimir Putin. “Russia’s ‘Satan II’ missile can carry up to 24 Avangards, which means one fully-loaded nuke would have enough firepower to wipe out all the major cities in the UK in one fell swoop. “China is developing a satellite system that can spot submarines at a depth of 500 metres which would render most fleets of Western nuclear submarines redundant and traceable. “Project Guanlan, meaning “watching the big waves”, was officially launched in May at the Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology in Qingdao, Shandong. Song Xiaoquan, a researcher involved in the project, said if the team can develop the satellite as planned, it will make the upper layer of the sea “more or less transparent”. “The device is designed to generate high-power laser beam pulses in different colours, or frequencies, that allow sensitive receivers to pick up more information from various depths. Those laser beams can scan an area as wide as 100km, or concentrate on one spot just 1km wide. It will be used in conjunction with a microwave radar, also mounted on the satellite, to better identify targets. Although the radar cannot penetrate water, it can measure the surface movement with extremely high accuracy – so when a moving submarine creates small disturbances on the surface, the radar will tell the satellite where to throw the laser beam. “These are just a few examples of a myriad of programmes that have already been developed and are being implemented as well as programmes in current development threatening the UK, and its NATO allies. “While other nations are spending on military hardware and upgrading their systems, the UK is falling by the side. The Ministry of Defence faces a £15 billion shortfall in its budget for the next ten years, and is barely functioning as of right now. “The National Audit Office said that the MoD’s equipment plan – used to fund military hardware including combat aircraft and submarines – “remains unaffordable”, with the department itself forecasting a £7bn gap between now and 2028. “The situation is deteriorating to such a level that the MoD is currently considering whether to pause a raft of big projects under the Modernising Defence Programme launched by ministers earlier this year. “This disgraceful negligence by current and past governments puts the UK in considerable risk not only now, but in the future. If it does not remedy these gaps in funding, and increase spending immediately, Britain will be a sitting duck in any future conflict. “Not only should the government increase military spending by at least 60%, it must also implement a national program for all citizens of compulsory military service, healthy males 17 to 21 years old will serve in the armed forces for 18 months. Compulsory conscription during peace time is a necessary preparation for future conflict coming soon. “The UK, must also expand its military preparations and increase cooperation with its allies, as they will be needed to bolster our defences when the conflict begins. “The UK must increase its army of hackers, because the conflict will most probably start with a massive cyber attack, which will seek to shut down Britain’s infrastructure, power, water, and transport. GCHQ must receive an increase of funding that will enable it to counteract an immense coordinated cyber attack. “If nothing is done now, it will be too late when the conflict commences.

The setting is the magnificent KIT Royal Tropical Institute, one of the city’s most remarkable buildings. Taking part in a series of exclusive round table conversations are ABN Amro, KPN, Nuon, Philips and PWC. The agency side is represented by BETC, Cheil, DDB, Superheroes, We Are Social and Wieden + Kennedy. They are joined by journalists from titles such as Adweek, Adformatie, and Werben & Verkaufen. The industry is embodied by opinion leaders from the EASA (European Advertising Standards Alliance), the IAB (Internet Advertising Bureau), the DDA (Dutch Digital Agencies) and the VEA (the association of Dutch communications consultants). Issues such as gender equality, sexuality, diversity, political extremism and climate change are impossible to ignore yet fraught with risks for communicators. When does purpose-driven advertising becoming “cause washing”? Is it still possible to create controversial or even non-politically correct campaigns? Our thoughts on this matter is that political correctness has come to such a level of censorship now that it is nigh on impossible to create anything edgy or humourous without offending someone who stirs up a stink and then gets you canned. Within the advertising world, it is now a serious no no to offend, because to some people everything is now offensive, and there are massive client budgets on the line. This is a symptom of years of social programming of soviet-style group think, which has leached out onto the mainstream media, and the advertising world. The media will no doubt report on the event’s key findings. Students from the New School Amsterdam will also be present at the event, which is backed by partners Adobe, Euronews, Screenvision and the EASA. Meanwhile, there are still places available for the Epica Awards ceremony itself, from 7pm on November 14, when the Royal Tropical Institute will become the stage for a celebration of the world’s best creative work, as voted by the unique press jury of the Editors’ and Publishers’ International Creative Awards.

Most passionate sports fans will choose to bet on what they’re predicting with hopes of making a profit. Regardless of which sport you prefer to bet on, it’s hard to ignore horse racing with it being recognised as one of the most popular betting sports. Most horse tips are built on either backing a horse to win or to place, with each variation having its own pros and cons that need to be assessed before staking any of your own money. By backing to win, you’ll be able to take the strongest price from your chosen horse winning. Getting behind a horse to place assures a smaller amount of returns if your horse finishes in the top few places of the race, guaranteeing something even if your horse is unable to win outright. By following a few simple rules, you’ll be able to heighten your bet’s chances of winning. It’s worth taking these extra steps before offering out any of your own horse tips as it will not only strengthen your bet but also potentially increase the winnings you could get if the bet lands in your favour. Finding horse tips to bet on The internet is packed full of places where you’ll find reliable horse racing tips. All of the good ones are picked in a way that makes use of statistics and form rather than randomly picking nags at random, and they’re all free horse tips, so it’s hard to not at least shop around before placing a bet on the sport. You need to be careful when looking at these horse racing betting websites, as not all of them put in the effort they should to provide visitors with worthwhile bets, but it’s easy to pick out a good one based on their track record and following. You’re able to make just as strong horse tips if you put in the same effort as experienced betting websites. All you need to do is look into the horse you’re considering betting on, checking how capable they are in winning the race you’re backing them to finish first in. Another factor is how capable other horses in the race are, especially in the instance where it turns out that there’s another horse that holds a stronger record in the type of race you’re placing money on.'], ['All Hail the Championship: The Most Exciting League in Europe', 'A t the end of the 2014 Premier League season, Manchester City topped the division, with Liverpool and Chelsea just behind, Spurs and Arsenal fought it out for fourth place and Manchester United struggled, finishing outside the Champions League spots. Sound familiar? Today in the Premier League, City sit on top, with the other five clubs placed in the same positions outlined above. Similar narratives can be told for the top leagues in Spain, Germany, France and Italy. Frankly, it can feel a bit like watching the same actors in movies all over again. Sure, someone like Leicester City, who shocked the world in 2016 with their unlikely title victory, can have a ‘guest star’ role, but those seem to be fleeting and increasingly rare. Unpredictability does not always equate to excitement, as sometimes unpredictability points to a lack of quality. However, the two do overlap, and one of the best leagues to see it happen is in the EFL Championship. Premier League money lifts relegated clubs The Championship is in a unique position of Europe’s lower leagues. Many clubs are propped up by the largess of the Premier League, receiving parachute payments over four years after relegation from the top flight. For example, last season Hull City, Sunderland and Middlesbrough each received £40 million from the Premier League as a result of relegation in the 2016/17 season. In Deloitte’s rankings of football clubs, current Championship sides West Brom and Stoke City have bigger operating revenues than top European clubs like Marseille, Lazio and several clubs competing in the Champions League. Of course, the Championship does not have the quality of the Premier League, nor does it always deliver the thrilling, skilful football fans demand. But, on a whole, the league enthrals fans, as exciting stars, such as Jack Grealish, Tammy Abraham and Yannick Bolasie, mix it up with the “blood and thunder” journeymen. The beauty of the league, however, has always lay in the fact that the big clubs, those who have entered the division with Premier League-quality squads, have always been hit with a rude awakening. Look at Aston Villa, Stoke and Swansea; all expected to return to the top flight as a consequence of having top squads, and finding themselves firmly in mid-table. Rich clubs not always betting favourites Indeed, the Championship betting markets favour clubs like Leeds United (7/2, Bet365) and Sheffield United (11/2), neither of whom have been in the Premier League for several years. However, that sense of unpredictability can also reward punters. Aston Villa, who boast an excellent squad, can be found at 33/1 to win the division, Stoke and Swansea at 40/1 and 66/1 respectively. Observers of the division will tell you: rule nobody out. The Championship is also furnished with decent television coverage, not usually afforded to other lower leagues around Europe. However, it is the crowds on matchday that really show how popular the league is. Consider that the Championship was recently ranked as Europe’s third most attended league in Europe, averaging 11,086368 in 2016/17. That’s bigger than La Liga, Serie A and France’s Ligue 1. Incredible. Finally, there are some intangible elements to the Championship that also elicit excitement from football fans, namely the stature and history of the clubs in the division: Table-toppers Leeds, one of the biggest clubs in English football history. Nottingham Forest, an intriguing long-shot bet at 25/1 to win the league, the club of Brian Clough and European Cup glory. Others, like Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers, have all played a role in shaping the nature of English football over the decades. Seeing these clubs struggle and then finally break the bonds to reward fans can be a joy to behold. Long may it continue.'], ['Spraying is Working: Global Decline in Fertility Rates', 'The inside of a sprayer plane that seeds chemtrails into the atmosphere The report, published in the Population Science Journal, followed trends in every country from 1950 to 2017 and found a rapid decline in fertility that has not been a surprise to scientists. “If one takes into account that in the West, the high usage of plastics, especially in supermarkets, and in food production, as well as chemicals like Bisphenol A which are put into bottled water and tin cans, as well as the myriad of chemicals put into food, hormones in meat, fertilizers and poisons in fruit/vegetables, vaccinations, wifi, cell phone radiation, GMO food, and the daily spraying of the skies by specialist aeroplanes, then there is absolutely no surprise that fertility rates have fallen in developed nations,” a scientist commented about the fall in fertility. Chemtrails are different to regular contrails left by passenger jets which dissipate almost immediately. Chemtrails are thick chemical laden deposits pumped out by specialist jets which criss cross the skies spraying the atmosphere. If one watches chemtrail seeding, the process is very slow as the streams of chemicals keep their linear form for awhile then morph into a cloud eventually falling to earth distributing the chemicals far and wide over a large area. It is not known what composes the chemicals that fall on to the populations and surrounding countryside below, however the statistics of a fall in fertility and vast rises in cancer since the 1950s do give an indication. There is, as of yet, no official explanation for spraying the skies with thick chemicals which fall onto the earth. One must understand that this spraying has been going on for decades, and is vehemently denied to even exist. Many people are too engrossed in their mobile phones or their lives to even look up into the sky these days, and many are asleep to what is happening around them. Western nations, and those above government, are killing their populations off with mass produced shit food, chemicals, and factory farming as well as the societal decline of the family from years of feminism. In 1950, women were having an average of 4.7 children in their lifetime. The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year compared to the fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus women are having one child, on average. As developing and third world nations advance their countries economically, they too will be targeted. The acceleration of infertility, cancer and other illnesses which are a symptom of developed first world nations, will soon encompass the whole globe resulting in an overall reduction in population.'], ['Death of Feminism: Sixties Style Free Love Coming Back', 'Feminism is now in its last death throes and many are welcoming a dawning of a new age, where free love reigns and puritanism is resigned to history. Professor Jonah Collins, at the University of Wichita, revealed the intricacies of the sudden change in mood. “When you have an age of puritan, politically correct, sexless boredom, people eventually have enough. You can’t pit the sexes against each other forever, eventually love wins through. This is what we’re seeing with the latest data. People want to have fun again, be happy, have lots of sex, and forget about the Marxist social justice warriors trying to indoctrinate them to hate the other sex.” Instead of hating, would it not be better for feminists to love? Gina Munche, a former feminist used to hate men but has seen the error of her ways. “I had been indoctrinated to hate men. Through school to university, that is all we were taught. Day in day out. I used to be an activist saying that all men should die and be killed, but one day I was walking home and tripped and fell on the sidewalk. I busted my head bad, and many women walked away. Then one guy he knelt down to help me. At first I was about to say I didn’t need no man’s help, but he went and pulled me up, and called an ambulance as I was cut up pretty bad. This guy didn’t ask for anything, he helped me in the ambulance and assured me that I would be okay. That’s the last I saw him. From then on, I know that all men ain’t bad. All men don’t want to rape women.” Since that moment Gina threw off her SJW anti-male activist hat and instead embraced men. These are some of the reasons many women who were previously indoctrinated in the soviet-style feminism and third wave are seeing that love is the true force of the universe, and not hatred. Men are no better than women, and vice versa, and we are all here for a specific reason, as the natural biological function requires.'], ['Boy Considered School Outcast for Not Enough Stabbing', 'London school, Stabbington Primary has been shut down today because there have not been enough stabbings this month. There have been sporadic incidents of children refusing to carry knives or participate in frenzied stabbing sessions down the local chippy near the school. “Education Secretary, Ron Shank, was down here last week and he disapproved of the low number of mass stabbings that go on on a daily basis. He said that we are well down in the Labour Mayor, Sadiq Khan’s stab league and we should therefore get more funding to buy more knives for our school this year from central government,” Headmaster of Stabbington Primary in Tulse Hill, South London, told the BBC. These certainly are worrying times for the Labour mayor who for two years has put all his efforts into producing a sub-class of feral children that are terrorising the general population and encouraging a climate of perpetual fear. The Labour mayor has refused any responsibility in the deterioration of attacks and urges more to be done, like decreasing police numbers further. Stab Britain Young boys especially in deprived areas of London are being ostracised for not carrying enough knives to school or participating in stabbings. Yesterday, in Prime Minister’s questions, Home Secretary Sajid Javid put forward a plan to integrate more children into the stabbing culture: “Children who have grown up in the London areas where stabbing numbers have dropped significantly must be transferred to areas where the London mayor still has not implemented a halt to police presence. We are doing our best to reduce police numbers, and I have ordered police to concentrate their resources to prosecuting Twitter hate crimes.” Since the Labour London mayor, Sadiq Khan has been in power, he has reduced the number of police on the streets and has made a concerted effort to encourage violent crime so that normal citizens have to live in perpetual fear of death. Under Sadiq Khan’s Labour mayorship London is now a crime ridden bloodbath where wild rat feral children happily celebrate their tenth birthday with a stabbing or two thus pleasing their friends, and it seems the current mayor’s office.'], ['Country Music Fans Gunned Down By Shooter', 'Similar to the Las Vegas shooting where 58 Country music fans were shot to death after Trump had been inaugurated as president, this latest shooting at a Country music bar holds a similar pattern. This sad terrible episode at the Borderline Bar and Grill, is positively another provocation, and we may soon see an escalation of politically motivated killings occur in America. The timing of the shooting just after the midterm election, and the recent firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions does suggest there is political motive, especially within such a polarised country. One minute you might be innocently line dancing, the next, you could be on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds. It seems that Country music is in line with a firm death sentence if you live in America. Provocations like this shooting usually escalate, and there is even a chance of civil war erupting soon enough, especially as there are so many people in America who are mentally ill and gun owners.

The same goes for democrat politicians like Maxine Waters who has urged violent opposition on any Trump supporters and those who work in the White House. Is this open season on Trump, especially after the massive win of Senators in the recent Midterm elections? The likelihood and probability to that question is, yes. There are already groups like Antifa who freely discuss murdering conservative supporters on Twitter. These individuals and groups are given carte blanche and freedom to plan their missions without any censorship or banning because they are left-wing. There could also be a backlash from other groups, the mid-American military militias, who feel that they are under attack by the mainstream leftist media. The tables have strangely twisted around, where the socialist democrats are now the aggressors and acting like Nazis, when they claim they are fighting the very same thing. Banning guns in America will not solve anything either because they will just go underground, and many will die defending their right to own arms. If any administration ever tries to ban guns, there will most definitely be a civil war. Naturally, the motive of this heinous act will probably be watered down, so as not to inflame tensions between the two political sides fighting each other by the authorities, however they should be honest with citizens and not cover anything up. Why not tell the truth once in awhile, it would be refreshing?'], ['Epica Announces Shortlisted Entries For 2018', 'After much cogitation and deliberation, the Epica jury have come up with a shortlist of stellar examples of prowess within the advertising field.

Suffice to say, it is okay to assault conservative women but not socialist women,” a shocked observer of the whole sorry affair remarked. Jim Acosta, is not only known for his unsubtle methods, but his brutish questions, and his behaviour towards women it seems. “She was just trying to do her job, her beautiful immaculate hair, her pristine smooth porcelain skin, one assumes she is barely over the age of 21. Who is this temptress who gripped the microphone so tightly, her perfectly manicured slender fingers held on for as long as she could, but was brutally assaulted in plain sight by this horrible man who calls himself a reporter? She awkwardly stood back, yet still held her womanly poise, a startled Bambi in the woods, and then eventually she took the mic and handed it to the NBC correspondent. If Bill Clinton had viewed this debacle, he too would have been stirred by this beautiful intern struggling with all her strength to keep her hand on the microphone. For a start, she is miles better looking than Monica, has a great grip, and has the ability to kneel down with such demure prowess,” a White House observer revealed yesterday. It is quite right that Jim Acosta, the accoster of the unimaginably hot female intern mic holder should be barred from the White House for his ungentlemanly violent conduct, but still, it is a disgusting detriment to the so-called #MeToo movement that there has been nothing but silence to what happened to this poor woman just trying to do her job in the White House. Last night was proof positive that the #MeToo movement is a sham, and only a politically motivated tool that benefits left-wing women. It does not care a damn if a conservative woman is assaulted by a man, therefore the movement is a one-sided vehicle of socialism and soviet style political ideology.

Adults travelling without children may want to take the opportunity to visit one of Prague’s casinos and then maybe try your luck playing some online slots back in the hotel? And although the city undoubtedly comes alive when the sun sets for the evening, there are still plenty of things to do throughout the day. One of those could be going to watch one of Prague’s many Soccer clubs in action. NEW FRONTIERS Eastern Europe has a long list of legendary clubs that before the collapse of the Iron Curtain were shrouded in a air of mystery, the only possible viewing of any clubs East of Berlin was if they were fortunate enough to paired with the likes of Real Madrid or Liverpool in continental competition. Thankfully though now that Europe’s borders are much more accessible, it has bought with it a rise in Soccer tourism and the city of Prague is at the forefront of a burgeoning industry that has grown over the past decade or so. Admittedly the standard of Soccer on display might not be at the very highest level especially when compared to the likes of La Liga in Spain or the English Premier League, but the atmosphere once in the ground is one that cannot be rivalled. Add the fact that the ticket prices are not the eye watering sums that would usually find when watching the likes of Real Madrid and Manchester United and a trip to one of Prague’s Soccer clubs does actually represent good value for money. While one should not also forget the fact that Czech lager is some of if not the best produced in the world, so what better combination could there be then a couple of cold pints of Pilsner Urquell while taking in a game. FORMER LEGENDS The name that is mainly synonymous with Soccer in this city is undoubtedly Sparta Prague, the club has been fortunate to call home to many international stars such as midfielder Tomas Rosicky and towering forward Jan Koller. Tomas Rosicky Not only have they been a production line for some of the greatest players to represent the Czech Republic international team they are also the dominant force when it comes to domestic Soccer in this country. The club have won no fewer than 33 domestic league titles, more than any other club. However, it must also be mentioned that they have not reached the summit of the Czech First League since the 2013/14 when they last won the title. They may be going through something of a fallow period in times of titles, not winning the league in four years is almost unheard of and it is arguably all the more galling when they have to look at their cross-city rivals celebrating success of their own. LONG TERM RIVALS Every big city needs a Soccer rivalry and Prague is no different, for every Sparta fan there is also a fan of Slavia also. In the 2016/17 campaign they won the Czech First League for the first time in eight years. A win that was all the more sweeter considering that they extended the trophy drought for their arch rivals Sparta. In terms of historic wins though they have not quite managed the same level of overall success. Slavia have been fortunate enough to win the Czech First League just 17 times in comparison to Sparta’s impressive 33. Therefore, arguably Prague’s second club are going to have a lot of work to do if they are to rule the roost in terms of trophies. However, there is not just the rivalry between Sparta and Slavia that is offer should you decide to take in a game during your time in Prague. This hot bed of Sport also offers up the possibility to watch other classic clubs. OTHER OPTIONS One that springs to mind is that of FK Dukla Prague, arguably made famous thanks to the song by British band ‘Half Man Half Biscuit’ who released the modest 1986 hit ‘All I Wanted Was A Dukla Prague Away Kit’ Arguably one for the Soccer hipsters, a visit to watch Dukla unfortunately is not quite what it would have been before hand. This is due to the fact that the club its original guise ceased to exist in 1996 when it merged with FC Pribram. So here you have a choice, you can either follow the original Dukla Prague in their new legacy as they are called 1. FK Pribram, however that would mean dropping down to the second tier of Czech Soccer. Or one the other hand if you feel you need your Dukla fix, then this is possible thanks to the club that has taken over the mantle. Although not legally recognised as the natural successor, FK Dukla Prague has gone a long way to restoring the pride that was once felt in the club. After winning the Czech Second Division in the 2010/11 season, they have since been a mainstay in the First League, and although they do not quite get the attendance figures that Slavia and Sparta do their fans are no less passionate. The list of options does not end their though, Bohemians 1905 should certainly not be forgotten. As the name perhaps suggests the club was started more than a century ago and although they have been a staple in Czech Soccer they have managed just a solitary league title. One that came over 30 years ago, back in 1982/83 to be precise. Since then their maiden Czech First League title they have failed to get anywhere near being the team to beat but again they have an ardent fan base that one day hopes that they will return to the very top. With the amount of options available to you, there is no reason not to check out a game of Soccer while embarking on your Prague visit. The only question is which team will you lending your support too?'], ['Proof that Illegal Immigration and Internet Purges Work: Dems Take the House', 'American socialist democrats have gained control of the House of Representatives, for the first time in eight years, and it’s all thanks to illegal immigrants and selective internet censorship that got them there. Dirty tricks and election meddling “If it was not for the illegal aliens who we helped get across the border and gave them lots of free stuff, they would not have voted democrat. If it was not for the massive internet purge project by socialist tech companies prior to the Midterms, then the story would have been very different. The socialist purge of hundreds of thousands of conservative leaning bloggers/political pundits/news sites, really worked, because we silenced their voices. They were party to mass illegal underhand practices and electioneering engineered to benefit the democrats, so we are proud of those tech companies, thank you. This is why illegal immigration and censorship is so important to us,” Nancy Pelosi, tearful but joyous told the press after the final results came through.

The Democrats now have the numbers to fuck Mr Trump up the ass especially with his proposed laws in the House and launch a string of damaging investigations into his administration through the committees they will control. The vindictive nature of socialism leaves questions on what investigation will be more damaging to Trump, his tax affairs or the ongoing Mueller investigation? The good news of the night included the loss of Texas for Beto O’Rourke whose campaign workers misused campaign funds, but will never be investigated by the FEC. “The dems are looking to impeach Trump any way they can, whether he drops a paperclip or leaves the toilet seat up, and they will find some piece of dirt to render him useless. He can forget about that wall being ever built, or that 14th Amendment bull. He’s a dead duck walking!” another jubilant democrat yelled after the results came in. The Democrats are right. You can win if you take away the voice of the other candidates in an election. By silencing the opposition through illegal, immoral purges and massive censorship, you can win. You can also win by harnessing the power of bribery, by helping millions of illegal aliens into the USA, you can tell them they have to vote democrat, and they will be your numbers, they will be your army, and it really does work as a technique that the Republicans do not utilise.

We socialise on our mobile devices, build friendships, find our way when lost, plan every aspect of our everyday lives, play games, and much more. Playing games has become a huge component of mobile interaction and, for many, is one of the prime reasons or motivations for purchasing a mobile device in the first place. Casino Gaming on the Go There are all sorts of mobile games one can enjoy for both smaller smartphone handsets as well as larger tablet-type devices. Some of these are available as free apps, while others require a cash purchase before you can download them to your device from your relevant app store. The free apps can be very good, although most of them will include advertising/spam or will require ‘in-app’ purchases in order to progress in the game. Online casinos have now also cottoned on the idea of producing a mobile app based on their regular online (desktop) casino platform. In most cases, these look and feel exactly the same as their big brothers, complete with a wide range of diverse casino games, all optimised for the smaller mobile screen. However, as more and more apps become available on app stores for Android and iOS (Apple iPhone and iPad), it becomes more difficult to find the best app for your needs. Those using Windows Phone operating systems or Blackberry are also now beginning to enjoy a wider range of suitable apps, and the same problem applies. Zeroing in on Trustworthy, Reliable Casino Apps If you happen to be looking for a solid, trustworthy online casino app in your relevant app store, you may be quite surprised and perhaps even overwhelmed at the sheer number of options available to you. There are hundreds of casino apps available but it is very important to realise a few things before you actually make your selection. You can find new sites and then look for reviews on Google. All apps are graded by users which is a good starting point in narrowing down your list of potentially great casino apps. It is a good idea to go into each app and see what users are saying about the app, which should indicate whether the casino app is worthy of your consideration. User feedback is like reading a micro review about whether the app can deliver on gaming, safety, user friendliness and reliability. Another good idea is to Google different online casinos and read related reviews on them. You can find dozens of independent reviews on top online casinos, including their mobile app options, giving you information on all key elements including: Safety and security Gaming options Mobile customer support Options for real money gambling Compatible devices Bonuses and other promotions Using these points as a starting point and a guideline, finding great online casino apps becomes a lot easier to do. Once you’re happy with the casino app, installing it is easy and only takes a few seconds to complete. Perhaps more importantly, uninstalling it is even faster, allowing you to try similar casino apps in case you aren’t that happy with the app you chose to go with.'], ['Midterm Elections: Americans Have Two Choices', 'These Midterm elections in America are crucial for the survival of the nation. On one hand there is business, innovation, and change to a more proud insular country that is self sufficient yet strong in the global field, priding itself in manufacturing its own goods and destiny. This side values freedom, liberty, prosperity for every facet of the US population. This is the side of Trump, who has brought actual change to America, and reinvigorated its core. The other side of the coin is Detroit-style dilapidation, Venezuelan socialism, open borders that will strain every part of the country’s infrastructure, Marxism, anti-business practices with high taxes, removal of free speech, massive censorship, soviet political correctness, self-hatred, and ultimately Chinese communism. Destruction of the US constitution. Gun grabs. Hand in hand with massive spending on socialist pet projects that waste taxpayers money and bankrupt the country into further deficit oblivion like Obama did. This is the side of the fractured socialist democrats who revel in mob rule, internet lynchings with no due process that lead to destroying whole swathes of innocent lives. This is the side of so-called progressive inclusive people who do not value freedom in any of its forms, whether freedom of expression or art or life. The choice is ultimately up to the voters, and if early polling shows, the fury of the socialists may trump the Trump supporters. It is however not too late to change this form of forced voting and use of illegal immigrants. Hopefully, many people have awoken from the NPC programming meted out on democrat followers. It is still not too late to awaken from the brainwashing, the incessant soviet repetition to instill their programming in your subconscious mind. The socialist American party, utilises a soviet technique of constant repetition to program their followers so they obey without question. This technique was used in the USSR and is still utilised in communist China to brainwash their youth to be completely subservient to the communist ideology and never to question the motives of their superior comrades. The democrat socialist party of America also utilises techniques devised by Saul Alinsky in the ways of mob rule, and civil unrest to achieve their soviet communist objectives.

Brexit voters were promised an end to EU rule, this meant an end to the UK under the Customs Union, and end to free movement and an end to rule from the ECJ and other EU controlling factors. One of the main reasons for voting was to get our parliament back, as a sovereign British parliament, not dictated to by Brussels. Sovereign freedom of Britain, to make our own laws again, and not be subjected to restrictive authoritarian rules as prescribed by the EU. The Conservative party throughout the last two years has shown great weakness, and an untrustworthy side which is frankly unnerving. If Mrs. May says one thing, then does the complete opposite thing, whilst still saying she is honouring the will of the people, this is a blatant lie, and her lies have been very damaging not only to her own integrity but to the integrity of the party as a whole. Theresa May and her Remainer Chancellor, Philip Hammond, along with her Remainer Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins are lying blatantly to Brexit voters daily as they prepare to push through the Chequers Brino deal which will doom Britain to become a vassal state to the EU indefinitely without a legal way out of the Customs Union. No one will vote for the Conservative party in 2020 who is not a Remainer. Yes, they will get some votes from the pro-EU faction, but the majority of people who voted for Brexit will vote with their feet and walk away from the Tories. The Conservative party today is a disgrace, and they will be duly punished for their treachery and treasonous lies towards the electorate as well as their perversion of democracy within the UK. The biggest fatality is democracy, because what we have seen in the last two years, is that there is very little of it left in Britain today. No justice, or democracy leaves a land which is seething with self hatred and is unjust, with little or no value anymore. To this end, it will be deemed as appropriate that many will abandon the Conservative party because of Theresa May and her cronies. These monstrous liars, quislings and treacherous chicken-hearted wasters who have demeaned Britain’s highest establishments with their all hat and no cattle empty worthless words, will be doomed to the opposition benches for the next thirty or forty years. Yes, by not voting Conservative anymore, the millions who voted for Brexit, will condemn Britain and the Conservative party to a purgatory worse than any death — the Labour party. We’ve lost everything else so we have nothing left to lose. This action alone will be fit enough punishment for the nation but it will be a lesson hard learned for the Tories, who stood by as their party was trashed asunder by the likes of Theresa May and her treacherous entourage of yellow lickspittle cowards and traitors.

The Landing Craft, Tank, (LCT) was made famous in campaigns like D-Day, and the Pacific war in the Second World War. The most common LCTs were the Mk5 LCT, which were used by British and American troops to land on the Normandy beaches on June, 6, 1944. Most of the LCTs were set for the scrap yard, however were saved by the plentiful money trench that is George Soros’ bank account. “He came into our office and saw a picture of one of our scrap LCTs. He asked me how many I had, and when I said 40,000, he took out his cheque book and wrote down a figure. He handed it to me, and I had to sit down. I just said take them, and he did,” Miles Kapernicko, the owner of one of the world’s biggest shipyards told Shipping magazine. It is not known what the price paid was for all the LCTs however an expert in the field estimated it to be in the region of $4,000 000 000 at 100k a piece. Many of the scrap LCTs will also need extensive repairs to make them seaworthy again, adding on extra cost to the Soros project. No one knows exactly what Soros is going to do with the landing craft, however some have an idea. “This will be like D-Day on Juno beach, or Omaha, but most probably will be migrants from South America onto the beaches of California, or from Morocco or Libya onto Italian, Spanish and Greek beaches. Our guess is that the numbers of landing craft landing at the same time will be unstoppable. No authorities can possibly stop that sort of invasion, and under the terms of the Geneva convention, these migrants would be classed as non-combatants and will all be accepted as asylum seekers. Many who land will just rush into land and disappear,” Johan Demisires, an expert on illegal migration told the Washington Times. If Soros can pull off migrant caravans on land, he can certainly pull off a sea invasion force numbering over 40,000 craft. If each craft can carry a capacity of 4,000 migrants, this would mean an illegal migrant invasion force of 160,000,000 could be deployed onto any Western nation at any time. The logistics for such an operation would probably be wide and numerous, however Mr. Soros and his empire of helpers are more than capable of pulling such an incredible feat off with little or no trouble. “If Soros pulls this one off, it will make D-Day look like a Sunday picnic outing. One can imagine the immense power and fear felt seeing one of these migrant naval invasions taking place. It would be a historic event,” historian, Gene Altrew, at the Smithsonian Institute told the Washington Times.'], ['Violent Vegan Vegafury Rampage Through City Centre', 'Doxeter, city centre was completely inundated by a mob of violent vegans on Friday, after another butcher shop opened on the High Street. Police were called out to the scene where vegans rampaged but stood there powerless, and did nothing. Dean Wotherfoster, 49, a butcher for 20 years was assaulted by a pack of vegans who smothered him with organic hummus, beetroot and lentil tabbouleh, topped off with a smattering of vegan nutroast. “I was chopping some ribs off a dead cow when in popped these vegans. They started to go red in the face as I chopped away. I thought nothing of it. Then they called me a ‘murderer’ and a ‘killer’ and when I tried to explain that I had not done the killing of the animals, they got even angrier and smothered me with vegan food. I must say, it was rather delicious, as I had skipped lunch.” One man who was sitting on a bench eating a sausage roll, was dragged by his feet to a vegan restaurant and a vegan sausage roll was stuffed into his mouth forcibly nearly choking him. Three workers on their break were tucking into their beef burgers when the vegan mob turned up. One unnamed vegan woman took the baps off the burgers then vomited on the meat. She then put the baps back on and forced the men to eat the burgers with vomit on them. They were later stretchered off to a hospital. By that time, a mob of vegans converged from the east, and bundled into a kebab shop where they screamed at the top of their voices at the staff. The vegans led a live goat and sheep into the kebab shop and forced the staff and customers to look at the live animals for four hours. After they left, the staff and customers were so traumatised that they threw down their kebabs and fled. At one shop selling milkshakes, a lactating woman removed her top and proceeded to shout ‘cow milk is extracted from grieving mothers’, she then squirted milk from her breasts into the milkshakes of customers whilst crying at the top of her voice. To her astonishment some customers continued drinking their milkshakes afterwards. All across the country, many towns were simultaneously attacked in what seems to be a coordinated attack.

The tapes reveal that vast amounts of funds on prepaid campaign credit cards which were meant to be used solely for campaign purposes were misappropriated and used to support Honduran illegal aliens from the migrant caravan coming over the border. These acts were perpetuated to gain votes and voters from the migrant caravan. • “I just hope nobody that’s the wrong person finds out about this.” • “It’s f***ing happening.” O’Rourke Campaign Staff Uses Pre-Paid Cards for Honduran Alien Supplies • “Don’t ever repeat this…” Campaign Staffers Explain How to Hide Campaign Expenditures for Aliens • “If you get caught in some sort of violation that’s like a $50,000 fine,” “For me I can just ignore the rules and I’m like f**k it.” • Transporting Aliens to “airports… bus stations,” “None of this is like sh*t there is a rulebook for” • Staffer Says She Sent Texts to Director; Told Campaign Manager Jody Casey, Who Says “Don’t Worry” Naturally, there is a stone cold silence from CNN and other so-called news services in America who are firmly aligned with the American socialist party, the democrats. Not one single socialist news source has yet reported on the massive levels of Beto fraud, and there seems to be a hush over the whole criminal case. The Federal Election Committee has also been silent about the Project Veritas findings even though the filming shows blatant disregard for any electoral rules or regulations. Below is the video criminalising all that appear in it. It is not certain how long the video will stay up as it is on the YouTube platform.

They explained that there had been some employees who were not so happy with the communist ideology, and that we should come over to re-educate them, as well as give more tips on how to censor non-communists better,” Xing Xao Ming, Chief Comrade in charge of Censorship for the Chinese state’s Information Ministry told Chinese state news Xinhua agency. Beat down There’s nothing like a good beating to get things going. The team of Chinese censors asked Gogle employees which one of them was not a supporter of Chairman Mao, or Soviet ideology Marxism. The Gogle officer pointed out a man sitting in the back, who had been outed earlier after his private emails were read out aloud to everyone assembled. “We converged on the employee, then tied his hands behind his back, then his feet were tied to his arms tightly so he could barely breathe. I asked an assistant to remove the employees trendy $450 moccasins, and socks. This form of torture and education is accepted fully in China so there was nothing to worry about. We then brought out a long flexible stick and beat the soles of his feet, all the while asking who he pledges allegiance to. At first, the screams were too loud for any words to be understood, but on the 40th stroke, he started to sound like a communist again. ‘Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!’ he yelped. He was then taken away on a Gogle stretcher with some fresh frappuccino to recover. We then moved on to the next suspect, who was caught uploading a pro-Trump video to YouTube.” Obey Chinese communist directive 39744-12 from the little red book states that all employees must pledge allegiance to Chairman Mao, and must abhor any form of free speech or free thought that is not sanctioned by the People’s Chinese Communist Party. Although Gogle has not yet adhered to the Chinese communist technique of firing squads, there is still time for the company to adapt their working practices to purge the company of any form of dissent. Information officer, Darcy Hernandez, says that compliance to Gogle authoritarian directives are a must within the global population, as well as employed staff on campus: “If you do not comply to our directives, we delete you, we demonetize you, and we effectively ruin your livelihood. You must adhere to all censors when they come telling you to censor your website because it has a different ideological political message other than communism. Marxism is the only way forward, and we have made this very clear by purging as many websites, and channels from the internet worldwide which we fully control now. We welcomed this week, a group of Chinese censors who very kindly gave us some extra tips, and advised us on best practices to censor non-communist content, and employees who do not agree with our political ideology. You can hide, but we will eventually find you and weed you out. We monitor everything.” Ah, a good day’s work spreading the Chinese communist message of censorship and thought compliance.

The British who are controlling the negotiations are firmly ensconced within the European side, and the real Brexiteers do not have any power in their parliament. We will therefore see a faux removal of the UK from the EU, thanks to Theresa May and her euro-centric Cabinet. This folly, will enable May to declare she completed the will of the people however in reality, Britain will be firmly placed within EU laws and regulations indefinitely. Britain has already eaten the multicultural pill, and there is no going back, however much some may try to reverse things. “The main raison d’etre for the Pan-European project was to counteract the Russian threat, as well as bolster Europe’s standing next to the super power of the United States. For this to engender a tactical advantage within the Western European diaspora there would have to be a genetic blend imported into Europe, to increase diversity, and plant the seeds of global acceptance. The homogenous nature of Europe must be bred out generationally, to create a new European, one who is a blend of many global bloodlines. This is why German Chancellor, Angela Merkel accepted with open arms over a million refugees from the Middle East in 2015. Similarly, Southern Italy has seen a deluge of human traffic from the African continent, which under the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan is key to increasing Europe’s diverse population targets. “Throughout the past three or four decades, we have seen the integration within Europe of diverse genetic mixtures flourish, and even though there have been attempts to halt this mixing, it has continued, and will continue until the whole of Europe is composed of a darker hue, from the extremities of the southern border to the north, east, and west. “The European project will move forward as planned, and so will its single currency. “Across the Atlantic Ocean, we have the United States, who is momentarily resisting the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan of integration, the pan-American uniting force of South and North America will go ahead despite the aspirations of Mr. Trump, who is imprisoned within a socialist system he alone cannot change. The only way Trump can change things permanently is to start a civil war, and win it. This latter scenario is highly unlikely, and the eventual demise of Mr. Trump will herald the resumption of the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan to unite the South with North America, relinquishing any national borders. The momentum for this break down in North American sovereignty is too great to stop without military intervention, and it is highly improbable that Trump will resort to such methods. “As new regimes, within nation states, come and go, there will be a stop and start method towards the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan, and this is perfectly permissible simply because this plan extends to centuries, and was never intended as a quick fix program. “We know of the challenges facing integration of certain global areas like Russia and China, but these will come eventually under the auspices of the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan. “All nation states will be moulded as one eventually, all holding an ethnically heterogeneous model, all borders will become like the EU’s Schengen zone, and eventually governance of all global sections will be ruled as one, centrally from Europe. The human race, will abhor nationalism to any particular state, and will only hold allegiance to the global state, where all economic, judicial, and every-day governance will preside.” Former EU President Herman Van Rompuy was awarded the European Prize Coudenhove-Kalergi 2012 “Peace and the European idea” for his exemplary work towards EU integration.

Standing amongst the grey miserable tower blocks, the smell of raw sewage and rotting garbage permeates the smog filled polluted air. This is Britain, and austerity has just ended officially. The High Roads now full of fried chicken shops, Polski Skleps, gambling dens and boarded up businesses covered in posters for the local DJ’s latest rave, only £5 to get in. Up above the high rises, the sky may be blue but it is replete with white lines criss crossing the air, these mysterious lines appearing from planes working day and night churning out chemicals that drop slowly onto the ground, to be ingested by the unknowing unawake population. The filthy pot holed roads, now a car park where the increase in traffic has been so immense from the EU, vehicles barely move over 15 MPH, people resigned to sitting in their cars twiddling their thumbs just stare out of their cars into nothingness. Driving in London is now such a nightmare, that it is preferable to simply crash your vehicle into a lamp post and walk. More cash has been allocated for the NHS we hear. That’s not what we find in the local GP’s office where queues of sick people snake out into the road, many too ill to stand just lie on the cold pavement and close their eyes in painful resignation to their fate. It can now take months to get a single appointment at your surgery. The immense influx of migrants over the years has effectively destroyed the NHS’ ability to function. God forbid you need hospital help, well you’re shit out of luck, there are no beds left. If you live in London, the daily stab victims coming through the doors are in a constant loop, blood and pieces of flesh dripping all over the tiles, and as you sit for your next appointment in eight hours time, you will no doubt see more stabbings and shootings directly in front of you, like some sort of theatrical display of death and mayhem played out in grotesque realism. The hospitals, replete with blood stained walls and mattresses, are now places where you go in and never come out again. They call it mercy, because living on a tiny island so overcrowded is like living in a nightmare that you can’t wake up from. If you manage to get an ambulance lottery ride to a hospital, the distraught overworked staff stick you in a corridor on a stretcher amongst the other cadavers. Your wait can last weeks or months, and sometimes surgery is conducted in the corridor if the doctors ever find your name tag. Many come here to die then are unceremoniously dumped in an oven and your ashes blasted over the city, an infernal snowing cloud of human misery. The rule for living in modern day Britain still suffering from mass migration is don’t ever get sick. Do everything you can to never fall ill, or you will put your life in serious danger. Just as Angela Merkel will be remembered as the woman who ruined Germany’s social service system, her counterpart, Tony Blair, will be known for war crimes, unfettered migration and the ruination of schools, hospitals and benefits, both of these monsters are socialists who have contributed to the destruction of their own nations from within. When Gordon Brown, the Labour Chancellor, and later unelected PM, sold off Britain’s gold reserves at the bottom of the market, he knew very well what he was doing, and did it with a grim Scottish smile. Let us thus celebrate the end of austerity, maybe on the way to a food bank to get a few rotting turnips to mash into a soup that will sustain you and your family of five until your next meal in a week. The grey miserable cities and streets of Britain, where the homeless are now part of the furniture, and the daily tax slaves begin their day of work so they can take home a few pennies after being taxed to the hilt, perpetually rising council tax, electricity bill, water bill, gas bill, internet bill, telephone bill, insurance bill, slashing the wrist and seeing the jet of blood spurt across the carpets and walls are a thankful reprieve to a life of utter meaningless tax slave misery. You are a tax zombie, condemned to a life of commuting for hours every day then death. Your meaningless life only compounded by episodes of Come Dancing or Big brother on the BBC taxed television you own in your leaking freezing grey home. It’s another day at work, the buses and trains are now full to the brim, the roads are the usual car parks, the hospitals, something from the Crimean war, the schools, overloaded where the English language is now a foreign sounding mush of lost syllables. You work the whole day and come home, then go out the next day to work in the same meaningless poorly paid job that destroys every single part of your fucking soul. Stagnant wages, brought down by the millions who took the jobs the Brits were deemed too lazy to do, your EU migrant boss is not happy with you, so he fires you. You breathe a sigh of relief. Maybe it is time to queue for days at the GP’s office and beg to be put on the waiting list for a mobile buggy, to drive you everywhere because you are too lazy to walk anymore. It’s okay though. Wake up. Haw Haw Hammond has been told to end austerity. Everything is ok now, Britain has been saved. Hurrah!

This is something the PM has lied about to her own Cabinet, who are being steered into a deal that will doom the UK to be a ‘vassal state’ of the EU indefinitely. Once the UK is signed up to the customs backstop, ministers will not be able to change anything, and there will be no ‘exit mechanism’ to break out of the backstop. Even if the MPs try to change things legally, this would take decades and most certainly result in failure, Theresa May’s own Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, has evaluated. The Chequers proposal involves the permanent continuation in the UK of all EU laws which relate to goods. All goods on the UK manufactured in the UK for the UK domestic market, or imported from non-EU countries, would be permanently subject to these controls. The obligation to follow the EU rulebook for goods would gravely impair the UK’s ability to conduct an independent international trade policy. In particular, it will prevent Britain from including Mutual Recognition Agreements for goods in trade treaties and this is likely to destroy the prospect of successfully achieving meaningful agreements with some of the prime candidates such as the USA and Australia. Theresa May’s version of Brexit which is known as a BRINO (Brexit in name only) would condemn the UK to be stuck permanently as a vassal state within the EU’s legal and regulatory swamp. The UK would still have to obey EU laws and ECJ rulings hindering its ability to develop an effective international trade policy or adapt the economy to take advantage of the freedom a real Brexit would have afforded it. The Theresa May Chequers capitulation will also mean that Britain will be stuck in the EU with no power to veto, and will still be sending vast amounts of money to Brussels, as well as being tied to EU regulations inhibiting its ability to make international trade deals. The destruction of Brexit by Theresa May and her Remainer allies, will ensure that no one who voted for a Brexit on June 23, 2016, will vote Conservative again, due mainly to the immense calculated betrayal by the prime minister and other pro-eu conservative ministers who aided and abetted the Chequers capitulation. The Conservative party will be consigned to the political wilderness for the next twenty to thirty years, because losing the vote of the leavers will let in the current opposition. Quite, rightly, no one will trust the Conservative party ever again, because it has reneged on every promise for Brexit, and abandoned its grassroots.'], ['Native American Filipino ‘White Supremacist’ MAGAbomber With Impeccable Timing', 'Too obvious. It has been a whirlwind few weeks into the run up of the midterm elections in the US. It started off with a massive purge of conservative websites from social media and the internet search engines, then went on to the Kavanaugh farce, then the orchestrated migrant caravan, and now we have a Native American Filipino MAGAbomber who has been made to believe he is a ‘white supremacist’ when he does not have a drop of Aryan blood in his body, driving around in an insanely ludicrous postered van with pictures of Hillary Clinton in crosshairs, sending fake bombs to democrats. If this is not election tampering then what is? These events are beyond any form of satire, however what gives everything away is the timing and who benefits from these events. Cui bono? Who benefits? Who stands to gain from all of these orchestrated events? They are all designed to make the democrats look like victims, and thus, the people should vote for them to get the other side out of congress. Anything that makes the Republicans look bad, makes the democrats look good and gets them votes. The magabomber fiasco is almost akin to finding the passport of one of the 911 hijackers immaculately preserved amongst the pulverised dust of the Twin Towers. Funny how the passport survived in perfect condition and everything else was crushed to dust. The official story was of course that a mystery man appeared out of nowhere, handed it to the police chief, then disappeared again, never to be found. Both stories are highly implausible. So, we have some idiot driving around in a van practically advertising himself as a security risk, apprehended and detained eventually. Not only is this guy an obvious plant, but he is possibly an alter. He was most probably vetted for months and then given the go-ahead a week or so before the midterm elections. We will never know the truth, because an operation like this is cloaked in utmost secrecy and this guy’s handlers are way out of the picture by now. Now, if you can get a Native American/Filipino person to believe he is a ‘white supremacist, then you can get him to believe and do anything…absolutely anything. Case closed.

This was all pre-planned, and orchestrated by key globalist players as well as their counterparts within national governments. “During this major upheaval, whole industries have died, and others have sprouted from their ashes. Whole areas of indigenous Western communities have seen their countries changed permanently by migration from the poorest nations. Cultures have been destroyed, and we have seen massive White Flight from whole cities in the West. “This forced globalisation where once rich communities have been flooded by the third world, are the work of globalists who did not do their homework. They did not understand the consequences of flooding the West with poorly skilled migrants, millions of people who instead of being a positive for the economy have drained it, turned wages down, become a burden on social services, and crowded the hospitals. “There is now a massive polarisation within communities, a vast chasm of ill feeling, and even thoughts of civil war, as resources run low from the migratory influx. “In Britain, we are seeing Brexit. In Italy we are seeing rebellion. In Hungary more dissent to forced migration. In Germany, the major recipient of migration, we have seen vast communities completely ignored by the authorities as they cater for the needs of migrants over their own citizens. In the USA, we are seeing migrant caravans daily coming from the poorest South American countries, organised by NGOs and other agencies. In France, we are seeing whole boulevards and neighborhoods taken over by tent cities made up of Sub-Saharan and Middle Eastern migrants. “The plight of these people are a symptom of global overpopulation, unfettered breeding, creating poverty, disease and pollution, then imported into the West by globalists. “Naturally, the elite globalists do not have to contend with this migratory influx. They live away from these areas, secluded in luxurious environs, where every whim is catered for. The globalist elite have special medicines that are not on the civilian market, and live on food that is not tainted by chemicals that the rest of the population have to live on. Their water is pure, and every month, large sums of money are deposited in their accounts, not only from the taxpayer, but from their companies. “Globalism is good. Globalism is a necessity when it comes to business. The new world order once assimilated will function in a global single market capacity, however the architects of globalism have underestimated the fight for national boundaries. The elite globalists have underestimated thousands of years of European history, and they will have to evaluate how they have misread the process of forcing migration on to Europe and the United States. “Why does China not take any third world migrants, Japan, Russia or Saudi Arabia? This is a simple question to answer. Because they have designed their societies and culture to reject assimilation with any other culture other than their own. This technique is not prevalent with the liberal socialist blank canvas of the West, where to be proud of one’s nation is immediately pounced upon and the individual is labelled a Nazi. Acceptance of migratory forces is therefore accompanied by liberal guilt if not adhered to by the masses and governmental factions. “The failed current globalist migratory experiment is now leading to serious unrest in the populations of the West. Fractured societies cannot be fixed by one singular solution alone, there will have to be many variables, however, the globalists have forcibly fractured whole swathes of people and at high speed creating a doppler effect in population shift factors. “The globalist elite will have to adjust their technique, and move towards stronger methods to impart their message. This could involve complete breakup of nations within the global matrix, internal warfare, or even warfare externally across borders. There are more step to take, and they will not be painless. “To exercise change in the long-term, there may have to be some eggs broken to make that omelette. True change can only come from a clean slate, a purge of the old system, and ultimately global warfare. This is the only way the new world order will truly rise, because once the globe is purged of the excess, and the old problems, it can start afresh creating the system that does not need wars, forced migration, mass consumerism, pollution, or mass factory farming. Once this has been achieved, a controlled population will be assembled which will allow the much needed regeneration of the earth’s resources.”'], ['20,000 Gamblers Make Migrant Caravan to Las Vegas Casino', 'Marvin Rogers, 63, an avid gambler all his life has today joined a migrant caravan of 20,000 gamblers travelling from Carson City, Nevada to Las Vegas. The distance of 466 miles has been crushing to many of the gamblers who are grossly obese, and have to have junk food snacks every fifteen minutes. “We started at 6.30 am yesterday and we only got eight miles into the journey,” Pamela Bourdain, 38, told CBS local news. The migrant caravan has taken the American press by surprise because it contains only Americans who are going to besiege Caesars Palace and demand luxury rooms for all, free meals, and no limits gambling purses. “Blackjack and roulette, and a little bit of poker, then a sauna, some ladies of the night, some powder, and a large slap up meal in my room, then more gambling,” another gambler trudging along the highway told news reporters slobbering at the mouth at the very thought of it. Along the route, many residents cheer the gamblers along, even throwing casino chips at them to spur them on to their destination. President Trump, a seasoned gambler himself did not condone the migrant caravan of gamblers but made a joke about the convoy: “I do not condone a caravan of people walking on their feet to demand things from other people or nations, but I have ordered Stormy Daniels to be at her post in the casino so when the gamblers get there, she will have to service each and every one of them.” When contacted, the management of Caesars Palace, were not sure how to counteract the news that the caravan was on its way to their casino. “You’re saying that 20,000 gamblers in a walking migrant caravan are heading over here? You say they demand free meals, free gambling, free luxury suites and free prostitutes? Anselmo, come here right now. Get them Mexican boys to build a wall around the casino with gun turrets. Nothing is free in Vegas. Nothing!” Chief spokesman for the gamblers caravan, Dwight Oros, was adamant that the gamblers convoy had every right to do what they are doing. “We have every right to migrate in our thousands to anywhere we want and demand we get free food, free gambling chips, free luxury suites, and women. This is our right as humans, and nobody can stop us. We want our payday, we’re owed this goddammit!!” UPDATE As of 13.00 PDT today, the migrant convoy of gamblers will reach the outskirts of Las Vegas.

What is all this baloney about limiting language or you’ll hurt her feelings. Men receive this kind of vitriolic language every day of their lives. Men get punched, kicked, abused, spat at, and demeaned in every media that exists today. Women wanted ‘equality’ well you better suck it up buttercup. You can’t just pick and choose which bits of equality you want and discard the nasty bits.” Twisting the heated knife The truth is that Theresa May is seeking to betray Britain by tying it in with the EU Customs Union, ECJ, and Single Market indefinitely, something she said she would not do in the Conservative Manifesto and which goes against any EU Referendum voter who voted to leave the EU on June, 23, 2016. Theresa May has effectively hijacked Brexit and ignored the people’s vote, and created her own Brexit in name only. Besides other serious discrepancies like extending the ‘transition’ period by years or months, May has capitulated to every demand that the EU has thrown at her. Theresa May, controlled by Olly Robbins, a key Remainer, and her Chancellor, Haw Haw Hammond, another key Remainer, as well as her Cabinet made up of Remainers and former Brexiteer turncoats, is massively bolstered within the Remain camp. The Equalities Minister added: “No kid gloves with this prime minister. She knew what she was getting into when she was shoehorned into the job. Women want equality. Well fucking well deal with what men have to go through everyday of their lives. This is what true equality means. Take those gloves off, take the political knives out of their handles and have at her for her betrayal of Britain. This is not a picnic. This is war!

Religion restricts the female form, it imprisons it in useless garments, and denigrates the beauty it exudes within the jail of religious dogma. In Egypt, Marisa has been put in jail for her endeavours to enlighten the masses from their religious brainwashing, she is the ultimate female warrior, who elucidates the blind religious fanatics as they call for women to be imprisoned further through ancient rambling scriptures written by all male mystics high on mushrooms eons ago who were ultimately afraid of the female form and its sacred geometry. Has it come to this, for this female warrior to invade the very ramparts of religious fervour with her body, just to prove a point about humanity’s proclivity to create nonsensical religious scriptures? If there is a deity worth worshipping, it is the clean bronzed outline of her perfectly formed ass and breasts delicately reclining on a carpet in a bazaar, or climbing an Israeli flag pole in Jerusalem. Her latest sojourn entitled ‘Turkish Delight‘ showcases a daring display of bush in the Hagia Sophia mosque, stretched out on the roof tiles of Istanbul, boating on the sunset filled Bosphorus, and cosying up on Turkish carpets, amongst many Helmut Newtonesque photographs, which if the DS was not under serious censorship and puritanical Victorian monopoly-tech-company controls would happily publish here right now. The Ottomans were certainly not strangers to the nude female form, however any bush flashing in a mosque would certainly have been dealt with with a swift beheading. Regarding the current climate in Turkey today, she is lucky to have left the country unscathed. Marisa’s own words about her Turkish trip when we asked her to explain some of the reasoning to her art were indeed illuminating. “I believe religion has done more harm to this world than good. Wars are built upon religion. “As for women, having to cover yourself up from head to toe is incredibly disempowering. I only wore this Burka for a few hours but I felt so imprisoned. The fact that their skin is never exposed to the sun…. Without sunlight there wouldn’t be life. Think about that.. “Of course, it’s easier for religious people to say in a state of denial, and just follow the book. But if everyone would start questioning and thinking for themselves, I believe we would come to the same conclusion. We are all the same and fighting about whose God is not going to help humanity any further.” Marisa Papen has already been banned by Twitter but can be seen on Instagram or her website.'], ['Indoctrinated Anti-Democratic EU NPCs March In London', 'EU NPCs An estimated 700,000 EU NPCs have gathered in central London today. The indoctrinated NPCs, all with the same EU placards all chanted the same thing over and over again. When asked why they were marching, many did not actually know, and said simply that they were told to march by their programmers. The EU ‘Non Player Characters’ marched from Park Lane towards Parliament Square where they stood chanting scripted programs given to them prior to the march. “We wish to stay in an undemocratic EU, where we are told what to say, what to think and everything is dictated to us. We have been programmed to obey the EU since childhood, and we have taught our NPC children to obey without question too. The collectivist EU Fasci-communo construct denies our freedoms and sovereignty, and imprisons the country under an authoritarian political and economic jail where there is no escape. Fuck Freedom. Fuck democracy. Fuck privacy. Fuck sovereignty. Fuck individualism. Fuck Freedom! Fuck Freedom!” the EU NPCs all chanted without their own consent or knowledge. Amongst the EU NPCs were a few MPs and celebrities who are in on the game, and are used by the programmers to bolster the deep indoctrination and EU programming. “We are here to oversee that the NPCs do not wake up. They admire us, and when they see us, this triggers further EU programming in their indoctrinated minds, this is how we control the NPCs,” a celebrity who receives large EU payments for the Actors Guild told the BBC. The NPCs, were cordoned by the police through their sheep pens, as they continued the march in orderly fashion all bleating the same mantras over and over again. All in all, it was another successful show of how mass indoctrination and mind control can work in tandem with very convincing effects. We must thank the EU and their programmers for a very effective control system utilised on the mindless pliable useful-idiot NPCs.'], ['America Uses Up Over 60% Earth’s Resources Makes Up Only 5% Global Population — This is Why the Migrant Caravan Comes', 'We are in the midst of another humanitarian disaster threatening the West. Much like the migrant caravan that swept into Europe in 2015, we are now seeing the same phenomenon on the borders of the USA. This time, the migrant caravan started from Honduras, travelling through Guatemala and now Mexico towards the USA. The abyss dividing rich nations with poor is now only too evident globally, as many people see through the internet how the rich Westerners live their lives. The internet has been the catalyst for a true awakening, when previously those in Third World and Developing nations lived their lives in blissful ignorance. Now, they want what Americans have, and they are prepared to die trying to get across the U.S. border. Who is to deny the plight of human desperation, the utter poverty these people are spawned from, and destined to die in as well? America, the richest nation in the world, now headed by President Trump will have to make one of two decisions, as the millions in the migrant caravan makes its way closer to the border. Shoot first, or take them in. This is a human invasion of misery and poverty, with women and children, but to let them all in will send an even bigger message, it will resonate throughout South America. Yes, you are all welcome, then the torrent will be unstoppable, and America will effectively be inundated. No doubt, this migrant caravan, much like the EU migrant crisis in 2015, will define the presidency of Trump, because what he does now will be very important to elections, midterm, as well as general in 2020. Obviously orchestrated, the migrant caravan is a last ditch effort by unseen forces to unseat Trump, and they’re using the plight of millions of people for their cynical gain. This method is always justified in the dog eat dog world of internal and external politics. However, America, as a sovereign nation has a right to defend its borders from invasion, whatever its form. This human disaster waiting to happen is another symptom of overpopulation and needless breeding, which only creates misery, poverty, terror, and ultimately war. The other symptom, is the greed of the USA, which fuels its need to use up 60% of the earth’s resources whilst leaving others with nothing, it is the very success of America which may one day be its ultimate undoing.

The relationship of Britain with European Unions has been unsure since Brexit and its impact on the Forex market and other global markets is also unclear. Although no matter the impact there is certainly going to be a long lasting effect. GBP Perspective: Due to the surprising events of Brexit the Pound Sterling has suffered. It was predicted that because of the country’s high debt situation the exit from the European Union would ultimately mean that the UK would be failing to pay its loans. Fortunately the Forex market is stable and wasn’t dramatically affected by the exit. Traders have to keep a close on eye on their investments and for opportunities. Brexit effect on markets: The UK has about 44% of its exports that go to the European Union and 7% of the European Union’s trade is made up of the UK’s exports. But the effect of a Brexit would mean that the trade would decrease considerably. It’s highly likely that both the EU and the UK would experience a financial slump. However, it is precisely in these situations that anyone involved with CFD trading at brokers like City Index, can prosper and hopefully see profit. Forex: The pound sterling is likely to fall considerably if Britain does end up moving towards a hard Brexit. The Euro could also possibly suffer because of the huge economic shock but the dollar could benefit and increase should investors look to invest their money in a protected economy. This can present an opportunity for Forex traders as they look to take advantage of sharp movements in the markets. Stocks: On the basis of stocks you need to be confident precisely which companies and industries are most likely to be negatively affected by tariffs, border checks and service regulations. The EU tariffs are extremely high when it comes to agricultural products, clothing, vehicles, food and tobacco. Furthermore, when assessing border checks it is inevitable that changes in protocol here are most likely adversely affect manufactured goods which include electronics, cosmetics, perfume and sports equipment. This sentiment is also true when it comes to services such as airlines, transportation businesses and financial services, where the main fear is how EU regulations will affect the business. Commodities: A hard Brexit could have different effects on investors. Investors could seize the opportunity to invest in safe and secure assets; this would ultimately mean that the price of valuable metals such as gold and silver could rise. There is bound to be a decrease in demand which means that there will be an increase in inflation. The impact of a hard Brexit is clearly going to have a strong effect on trading but this means that traders or rather investors need to make smart decisions and be wise with what they invest in. With safe and smart decisions those who trade could ensure that they are not affected by a hard Brexit.'], ['Arc Champion Enable Favourite to Add Breeders Cup Turf Success', 'J ohn Gosden’s supremely talented four-year-old Enable made headlines when going to France and upsetting the party, connections returning from Longchamp with the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe trophy tucked away in their hand luggage. The champion was driven home by jockey Frankie Dettori in stunning fashion, scoring off a starting price of even money, a chasing pack led by Sea of Class and Cloth of Stars biting away at her heels. Despite weakening in the closing stages, the victor held on to bank the €2,857,000 prize pot. Success on French soil over 1 ½ mile continued Enable’s fine recent form, having appeared in the winner’s enclosure at Kempton a month previously, landing the Group 3 September Stakes when 8/15 jolly, beating Crystal Ocean into second. The hat-trick is now on and handlers are aiming high with a trip to Churchill Downs for the Breeders Cup World Championships planned. The latest betting at https://www.paddypower.com/horse-racing has Enable marked as favourite to win the Breeders Cup Turf on Saturday 3 November with 4/6 the most recent offer. The fact she’s amongst the shortest prices in one of the biggest horse racing meetings of the year explains exactly what traders think of the British invader. It’s little wonder the money men are desperate to keep her close as her credentials include, as well as the Arc, Group 1 races the Oaks, Irish Oaks, King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Yorkshire Oaks according to https://www.racingpost.com/profile/horse/1236333/enable/form. As far as a run of form towards Kentucky goes it doesn’t get any better. That’ll ensure it’s not just the British pounds supporting Enable as she bids for a place in the history books. For as talented as Gosden’s pride and joy is, backing odds-on shots at the big meetings isn’t for everyone so there will be plenty happy to take a chance and oppose the fav with something at a bigger price. The main danger, according to the trading floor, is Roaring Lion who can be backed at 7/2. The three-year-old grey colt is another out of the Gosden yard and is another who carries bags of confidence thanks to a strong recent run of results. Last spotted winning the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown beneath the ride of Oisin Murphy in September, that accolade now sits in the trophy cabinet alongside the Juddmonte International Stakes, Coral-Eclipse and Dante Stakes. Further down the pecking order, we find Crystal Ocean for Sir Michael Stoute at 6/1. A winner of the Group 2 Hardwicke Stakes at Ascot in the summer before finding only one too good in the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes and September Stakes, ending 3 ½ lengths off Enable in the latter. There’s more of a price to be had if trusting your stake to Talismatic who stands out at an easy to love 12/1. The five-year-old colt hasn’t won in two tries since August, as his form shows http://www.attheraces.com/form/horse/Talismanic/GB/2890619 but his last success shouldn’t be easily overlooked, coming in the Group 3 Gontaut-biron Stakes around Deauville.'], ['5 Ways For Journalists to Survive Visiting a Saudi Consulate', 'The sad demise of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi when he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul has prompted many journos to come up with some innovative ways to avoid certain death when entering a Saudi consulate. Only ever enter a Saudi consulate with a full camera crew. At least this way, if a hit squad member takes out a bone saw and tries to chop off your leg, there will be a crew of five or so press people to either deter the attacker by filming or fight him off. Alternatively, dump the camera crew mentioned earlier, and opt for a full squad of mercenaries armed to the teeth. If you are then greeted by a grinning Saudi with a bone saw and injection, just click your fingers and duck. After the shooting stops, simply fill in the necessary forms you came to fill, and leave. Enter the Saudi consulate wearing a full set of Medieval armour. This way, if a Saudi hit squad member tries to dismember you he will be shit out of luck. Don’t forget to bring a broadsword with you to defend yourself with. Hire a tank for the day. When outside, shoot a few volleys into the front of the consulate, or simply drive through to the office where you have to fill in the forms. If you are applying for a Visa, don’t forget to present your passport and additional ID through the tank’s hatch. Lastly, possibly the simplest of solutions. Never deal with Saudi journalistic ventures, and if you are a Saudi national, never write anything critical of the brutal regime. This year alone 44 journalists have been killed worldwide.

Squalid “She was begging us, she dropped down on her knees, this pitiful character sobbing like a wet flannel, like a dog, so I pushed her away, disgusted at her weakness,” one EU official revealed in the pub afterwards. We already know that Theresa May is not capable of negotiating her way out of a paper bag, yet she puts herself through this punishment over and over again. May is a useless prime minister, who has not achieved a single thing of note during her premiership apart from present a bizarre capitulation to the EU called her Chequers BRINO (Brexit in name only) deal. “It was embarrassing watching this sad woman, she knows she is betraying Britain, and even though we want to stiff your country, we hold no love to someone who willingly betrays and lies to their own people. Has she no shame?” another EUcrat revealed. The desperation May has displayed in her so-called negotiation is sickening to watch. She may take her orders from Olly Robbins, the Remainer in charge of orchestrating this farcical sham, but surely this is no way to negotiate anything. One must have a position of strength, and be willing to walk away if there is a bad deal put forward, yet May persists in her shameless sickly desperate attempts. Has the great nation of Britain come to this? Please, we beg someone, or something to remove this awful sad sight. It is truly upsetting, and distressing to see this once strong country reduced to begging desperately and willing to take any piece of scrap thrown by the EU. Stand up! Get out! Leave!

This is what it was like when they gave me a ticket to review this movie. Let’s just say that to watch this film you need a stomach of steel, and nipple clamps hooked up to a 100 volt battery to keep you awake. The film was directed by up and coming director NPC, produced by NPC, and the stars of the film were NPC, and NPC. We also get a great cameo role by none other than NPC. CNNPC gave it 5 stars out of 5, and so did MSNPC. According to the blurb, the film was heavily funded by the #NPCToo and NPCLivesMatter N-P-C organisations. The opening scene brings forth a wall to wall NPC crowd all chanting the same thing. Over and over again, the same words are chanted by the NPCs. Hundreds of thousands of them all with the same NPC chant, and the same NPC face, and the same NPC march. This scene lasts for over two hours as they chant the same old mantras that these brainwashed NPCs like to do on a constant basis. This nightmarish film depicts a dystopian world where brainwashed drone-like NPCs led by their programmers, who are never seen, shout out their Marxist communist mantras to all and sundry. They do not know why they are doing what they are doing, but they do it anyway. They are basically mindless angry soulless automatons roaming the streets and shouting at the top of their lungs, without any knowledge of why they are angry in the first place. Frankly after the fourth hour of watching the NPCs marching up and down, chanting “No Fascist USA K – K – K!” I literally wanted to shave my eyeballs with a rusty razor and poke my scrotum with knitting needles just to escape this vapid, brainless, banal idiocy. At one point the NPCs started a ‘rape’ chant. “All men are rapists!” By then I decided to toss my popcorn and upturn my iced drink over my head. Another four hours of NPCs screaming about the ‘patriarchy’ and ‘white males’ got me into a cold sweat. I fled the room, I felt dehumanized by the chanting. I could not take anymore. I was lucky I was in Portland, Oregon, where these kind of things never happen in reality. That is, until I stepped outside the cinema straight into a….

The advent of the Internet has brought entertainment to our door, or rather, to our screens. The same is true about online casinos, that can nowadays be easily accessed within a second in our browsers or through dedicated software. The Advent Of Online Gambling If you are new to online gambling, it might be rather useful to get adjusted with the types of software by trying some free online slots. With online slot machines, you won’t need much practice given that the principles behind them are fairly simple. Afterward, you can try your luck and win real money in online casinos, where all the stakes are real just like the thrill. Regardless of your level of experience, it is always essential to exercise caution when choosing betting amounts and to keep your impulses under control. How To Choose Your Casino Among the things you should keep in mind when choosing an online casino or game are the following: Chances of winning. With many types of games, especially with online slot machines, it is very easy to do some very simple math in order to learn about the winning chances. The fact that the odds of winning are rather easy to grasp and the rules are very simple and straightforward makes it the preferred type of gambling game, with about 70% of the income in an average US casino coming from this type of machines. In order to get a grasp of the winning chances or the principles behind more complex games, one could look for more information online or on dedicated forum pages. The payout percentage. This is essentially the amount of money that a slot returns to winners divided by the amount that it takes from all the bets. Typically, the payout percentage for a slot machine varies between 75 and 98%. Obviously, the casino needs some profit in order to be motivated to operate the business, however, some casinos are more generous than the others. One should always remember that a higher payout percentage results in greater jackpots or in more winning chances (depending on the game) because more money is left for the players. The amount of jackpot. Obviously, if one is to gamble, there must be a motivation. While some games have a fixed jackpot, others would increase it with time (progressive jackpot). While betting for a lower jackpot is a less attractive idea, keep in mind that higher jackpots attract more players and, depending on the game, winning chances for an individual might be decreasing if more players are participating. Look out for the types of devices supported – for instance, if you only used to play the game on your smartphone, make sure that the casino has an app for it before signing up and loading money to your balance. Fortunately, top online casinos normally support multiple operating systems and devices. Payment alternatives. To be able to bet money or make attempts with the various gaming software, you would need to load the money with a payment system convenient for you: be it a bank card, like Mastercard or Visa, or an online payment system, like Skrill. Many platforms would even accept bitcoins. By contrast with traditional gambling, online gambling is beyond any geographical restrictions and schedule restrictions, with cases of people winning the jackpot online even during conference calls at work. Sometimes luck just needs an additional chance.'], ['Looks Like It’s Back to Work For Stormy to Pay Off Lawyers Fees', 'Stormy Daniels One must feel for poor old Stormy Daniels, here she was expecting a massive extra pay-off from the Trump team, and vindication for her ‘claim’ that she was threatened by a man wearing a wooly hat, but now has to pay off massive legal fees after being stumped by the judge. “I gotta get back to work.

That meant leaving the EU Customs Union, leaving the European Court of Justice, leaving the Single Market, leaving every single part of the EU.

Congratulations are to be given to Harry and Meghan, who today announced the arrival soon of the first ever black baby into the undiluted royal bloodline. “Harry and Meghan are pioneers in the history of European royalty. Never before has the African genetic bloodline been introduced to any European royal family throughout the whole of history. Prince Harry must be truly proud of himself for breaking the mould to introduce those African genes into European royal circles with his new wife, the beautiful Meghan,” royal historian Alan Starksy, told the BBC. How will the Saxe-Coburg Gotha genetic lineage deal with the introduction of the African genetic bloodline? Geneticist Dr. Werner Andrell, from the Institute of Genetic Global Research in Lausanne, Switzerland, revealed some interesting points about the new royal arrival. “Colour of the skin does not matter, because to say it does is completely racist and unacceptable. It is however fully possible through the generational transfer of genes that the baby will be fully black, maybe only taking a few attributes from Prince Harry like his ginger hair although with negroid characteristics. Some genetic traits can skip whole generations and suddenly appear seemingly out of nowhere. There are also certain traits related to African genes, like Sickle cell anemia, and genetics relating to temperament, like the ability to dance rhythmically in time to music, as well as the ability to rap and run fast. The grandmother, an African American has lineage from the slave days of old, and this will ensure the ability of the child to endure hardships easily, as all these genetic traits pass through generationally.” Disgusting stereotypes of African Americans, like their supposed extremely low IQ, propensity to steal, and commit savage acts of violence as well as their constant angry attitude should be dispelled with the new arrival as he/she will be brought up amidst the highest luxury, privilege and educated in the most prestigious institutions.

Situated in the leafy Brussels address of 41 Rue de la Loi, 1000 Bruxelles, Belgium, international visitors to the museum number in the millions every year, to explore the fascinating world of farting. Curator of the museum, Monsieur Connard Raseur, welcomes initiates to the world famous Fart Museum to enjoy the sounds and smells of farts dating back 150 years. Brussels Sprouts “Today, we are celebrating 150 years of flatulation, or farts. We are truly honoured to have the president of the EU, Jean Claude Juncker, attend the celebration, where he will sniff a fart from 1937, and give us his verdict on its vintage quality. The EU grant of 350 million euros last year was greatly appreciated. We have also heard he is a particular expert in farting himself, and enjoys nothing more than to distribute cognac tempered Brussels sprout farts whilst in the EU Commission elevator filled with secretaries. Monsieur Juncker, will be invited to inter one of his famous farts as a special treat to visitors and many generations to come.” When one enters the fart museum they are instantly amazed at the amount of bottled farts exhibited. “We have bottled farts extending all the way back to 1868. C’est merveilleux. The fart from that particular year was preserved in quite a large bottle, and is still perfectly sniffable. According to our museum records it was presented to the museum by the family of a German gentleman of the era, his name, Heinrich Furz, is clearly written on the bottle label. His fart was preserved after he had ingested a meal of Königsberger Klopse, some Spätzle, and a large portion of Stollen, washed down with copious amounts of strong Bavarian ale. “One of our most interesting farts is found from a bottle sealed and labelled in 1964. This vintage fart was produced from an old lady who at the time lived in a house on rue De L’abreuvoir, where she sold her farts as an aphrodisiac to Parisian gentlemen frequenting the local bordel, where the filles de joie would work day and night. It is said that Pablo Picasso, was a particularly frequent visitor to the Madam’s salon where he sniffed away the peculiar aroma to his heart’s content. Visitors to the Fart Museum can also sniff vintage farts that are available on any particular day. For example on Tuesdays, the museum labels it ladies day, and tourists can sniff the female scented rosey farts backdated 150 years. One visitor from Ohio, USA has visited the museum hundreds of times and is today sniffing a fart from 1945. “There was a certain aftertaste to the nasal palate. An austere aromatic almond smell, resonating with embellishments of beefy farmyard blackcurrant tones furnished with strains of hydrogen sulphide suggesting a smattering of bad eggs mixed slightly with the heady bouquet of chaptalised cat’s urine. One of the more unique farts I have smelled. Let me have a look at the bottle, ah, this one was siphoned from the asshole of a Vichy collaborator governmental official who had recently been captured after the second world war had ended. Marvelous, I would never have guessed.” To celebrate 150 years of farts, the museum is giving away a small bottle of vintage fart gas to every visitor who comes to the museum from the dates of 15 October to January 5th 2019.

The de facto hipster uniform consists of a flannel shirt (the looser the fit, the better), a pair of suspenders, and a pair of Converse trainers or Doc Martens boots (bonus points if they’re seriously beat-up). But have you ever stopped to wonder why that shifty-looking young person became a hipster in the first place? Have you ever asked them to put down their can of Pabst Blue Ribbon (the hipster drink of choice), to actually have a conversation with them? We’re guessing that the answer to those questions is no. If you had, you may be surprised with what they’d tell you. Hipsters are Just Unemployed Lumberjacks What our research has brought to light is that it’s no coincidence that the clothing worn by hipsters just happens to be the exact same uniform that lumberjacks wear to work each day. Hipsters are just unemployed lumberjacks, left out of work due to the shift to a digital age, where people don’t need such primitive tools such as notebooks and paper for printers because they have notes apps on their mobiles, and emails. There’s not even a need for books any more since e-readers like the Amazon Kindle are en vogue, letting everyone everywhere squint at screens to get their Harry Potter fix or that oh-so-scandalous fanfic that turned into a light BDSM franchise. And it’s not just fiction books that are going out of style either. Bingo halls have even ditched their paper bingo books, with the Buzz Bingo bingo club chain adopting electronic tablets inside of its venues. Just to add salt to the wounds of these poor, out-of-work woodcutters, there are even bingo apps that let people play on the go. Sales of print newspapers are declining, meaning your fish and chips will no longer be flavoured by the tangy, metallic taste of printer ink. And who needs magazines when you’ve got your Facebook newsfeed anyway, and who cares that it’s full of targeted advertising and malicious trolls paid by shady groups? Will Lumberjacks Ever Get Their Jobs Back? But it’s not all bad news for the humble hipster either! They needn’t sit around figuring out how to make their fixie bikes startup take off or trying to hawk rotary phones to passersby on the street (never eBay, that’s far too mainstream). There are plenty of alternatives to keep lumberjacks in work. For example, they could go overseas and become the Brawny mascot, being the official face of kitchen roll and wet wipes everywhere! But come to think of it, as the paper towel brand is known for its products lasting a while, this could potentially put other lumberjacks out of business. Other top career suggestions include being a software engineer, a human resources manager, or a financial planner. Why not become a master coder and make your own apps? Or drag unruly employees back into line? A financial planner would also be a fun job so long as you can count, or if you know the basic functions of a calculator! And while these careers are not hipster-friendly nor does lumberjacking offer any transferable skills that would help in these jobs, given that lumberjacking is considered one of the worst jobs you can do, and software engineer/HR manager and financial planner are considered some of the best, we’d say that it’s a considerable step up. Don’t be sad, hipsters of the world. Felling trees isn’t the only career out there!'], ['How to Fix the “Api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll is Missing” System Error', 'L ots of users confront similar errors every day because their applications fail to find the essential run-time components. If you have received the above message, you are probably in search of effective fixes for it, too.

When the program successfully uninstalled, make sure to perform its installation again.'], ['Collapsing into Collapsology', 'One rarely gets a glimpse into the machinations of the concept of collapsing, the intermittent process of deconstruction or the faltering shaky atmosphere before it all ends with a big thud on the sofa of eternity. The atmospherics of Daria Geller, an upcoming director of photography and filmographer, are all too apparent with her new fashion video entitled Collapsology. The cinematography is borne from the lens of this talented Russian beauty, who now resides in Israel and Paris, a powerful mix of destinations to formulate her art. Shaking, rhythmic camera sweeps, and lens filters bring forth a torrent of uneasy motion as the dim lodgings of decaying post-Soviet Russia come into view. Watching the video, there is a touch of Danny Boyle, Trainspotting going on, and maybe some Abel Ferrara added into the mix. We’re not sure what type of fashion item this video could sell, but its style is most certainly within the expensive perfume niche. One can imagine a Parisienne lady enchanted by the dramatics in the video, instantly going to her local perfumerie to slap on the scent of Collapsology against her delicate silken pale neck, as long as there is no Novichok involved..(bad joke). What does this video say about Russian, English relationships, yes they are fiery, but as the acting collapses into bitter words from the Russian model, the English model collapses with resignation back into her arms? It is clearly a love hate relationship, and the confused overlapping dialogue suggests that collapsing is sometimes bad, and good at the same time.'], ['Why Liberty, Freedom and the Right to Self Expression Must Be Fought For to the Death', 'Nothing ever comes easy in life, one has to fight for every little scrap, whether it is the last morsel of food in a family of ten children, or that elusive A grade in an exam, or that job application where thousands have applied. Freedom, and the right to free speech is much the same, but this concept is the hardest fought battle, for there are many who seek to remove this human right from our table. There are many today who actively seek to remove the rights our forefathers fought for to the death, and these enemies of freedom are working in concert to completely erase hundreds of years of work in one fell swoop. Just as our forefathers fought for freedom, there will come a time soon when many will say enough is enough, and they will too wake up to what is going on. The insipid totalitarian tiptoe of soviet communist ideology which seeks to remove our Western democratic freedoms by uttering their Newspeak. Utilising selective keywords to describe their purge of free expression; anything that is not their ideology is thus deemed as ‘hate speech’, and anything that questions their robotic Orwellian narrative is called ‘fake news’. These linguistic terms can be used to remove anything they want, and without any recourse or explanation, such is their anti-freedom fervour. The underhand tactics for removing freedom of speech, is one that has been utilised many times in Soviet countries of the past and present, in the USSR, in East Germany, and in Maoist China. Soviet creations like feminism, and political correctness are also a tool used to undermine free speech and freedom. Unfortunately for those who value freedom, these communistic forces reside in much of the media and Silicon Valley. Infiltrated — the higher echelons of government, and the intelligence agencies, work in consortium with the communist sympathising media elements and tech conglomerates to purge all forms of dissent of the Soviet communist ideology to which they subscribe to. Communism is now pushed in American universities, and British universities as the only way forward, even though this totalitarian political ideology has been responsible for over 160 million deaths throughout history with its great purges. The youth of today are being thus trained as ‘Comrades’ and ‘Bolshevik’ fighters, who abhor freedom of speech, privacy or any form of individualism. They instead only support the collectivist mantras spoken by their Marxist professors, who send these brainwashed robots into the world to prepare them for the coming attempt to eradicate democracy, freedom and capitalism. Thomas Jefferson once said: “The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” What the ‘useful idiots’ do not know, however is that if they were to take full control and complete their mission of installing a full communist state, they themselves would be purged, in the first instance. This is what communists do, the higher echelons of the communist structure, order the deaths of all who helped them get into power, for a very simple reason, they have been tricked into believing the ideology in full, and are thus deemed dangerous, because if they feel betrayed in anyway, they will turn on their leaders, and the hierarchy does not want that threat looming over them. To stop this communist takeover, which has unfortunately infected much of the previously moderate left-wing media, the fight will be long and arduous, and those who value freedom, will have to have help from those in government who value freedom as well. From the lowest point to the highest point of government, we must have your assurance that you will do everything you can to clean the swamp, to eradicate the Marxists from their positions of power, to extricate their funding, to devalue their anti-freedom push, and to disable their methods of undermining our inherent rights to free speech. The biggest threat, of course to the West today is China, and its Maoist ideology has infiltrated the West, including the left-wing tech media companies. One search engine monopoly is even working on a Chinese censored search engine, which they will use as a model to infiltrate the Western model. One social media company has a devout communist CEO, who even speaks Mandarin, and has married a Chinese wife. He has been completely indoctrinated in Maoist communist ideology, and is seeking to expand his already large empire into China. This will involve more censorship and the disavowment of democracy, free speech. The EU, is another major threat to freedom. This is a totalitarian entity that has already impacted on freedom of speech and utilises its economic might to force nations to comply with its communist collectivist ideologies. This anti-democratic state is run solely by unelected officials in the EU Commission. In Britain today, there is a big fight going on to extricate the UK from this un-democratic authoritarian manifestation, and to bring back Britain’s sovereign free status, as well as its freedom to make its own laws, and conduct its own trade deals. The fight is further compounded by the communist voices within the UK who are trying to thwart Britain’s exit. The sheer depth of the infiltration of these communist operative into the West is immense, and it will possibly take many decades to fight for our freedoms, that our forefathers fought for all those years ago. “Freedom of speech is a principal pillar of a free government: When this support is taken away, the constitution of a free society is dissolved.” Founding Father Benjamin Franklin. If you don’t want your children, their children, and their grandchildren, to live in a totalitarian communist dictatorship where there is no freedom of speech, freedom of expression, then you must act now, you must make your voice heard, vote those who subscribe to socialist communist ideologies out of office, deny the socialist power by not using their services, boycott those who deny freedom by censoring, and you must ultimately help those who wish to change this communistic creep that is setting in on our once Western democratic free society by fighting with all of your might to get rid of them once and for all. Once we lose that right to free speech…it’s never coming back…that’s it…gone. “If men are to be precluded from offering their sentiments on a matter, which may involve the most serious and alarming consequences that can invite the consideration of mankind, reason is of no use to us; the freedom of speech may be taken away, and dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep, to the slaughter.” — George Washington, first U.S. president'], ['Don’t Worry Folks Dow Drop of 836 Today Was Nothing', 'Don’t worry folks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 831.83 points lower today at 25,598.74.

These are early days yet, because we still have a 60% drop to contend with. So, what’s causing all this stuff to happen? Well, there are multiple variables causing the little drops. The main issue is of course China, who are not playing ball with Trump’s tariff changes. The Chinese are intent on bringing some chaos to the U.S. markets utilising underhand methods, after Trump trumped their easy money-making deals where they were stiffing America with unfair trade deals. Let’s say, there’s the dumping of U.S. bonds, as China is pretty much the largest holder of U.S. debt, and there’s the retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports into China. This whole clusterfuck puts a strain on manufacturers and companies on both sides. Wherever there is China, there is always Russia, and the sanctions put on the country by the U.S., EU, and UK, have created a deeper alliance with the Chinese economically, as well as politically. Then we have the U.S. tech companies colluding with each other to censor everything on the internet that is not socialist, or communist. This action has reawakened a serious investigation into anti-trust regulation, which will break-up many of these monopoly companies who have misused their positions of power for the gain of the socialist movement in America. Regulators are already prepping to proceed with slapping these companies with serious fines and regulations, as well as breaking the bigger ones up into smaller manageable sizes. These are just a few variables, we have mentioned, as there are many more, like rate rises, but we don’t want to write this shit all day. Grumble, whisper…martial law…Capitol Hill arrests for treason…Silicon Valley arrests for corruption/meddling with elections…whisper…whisper..cleaning the swamp..FBI/CIA insiders…midterms..etc..

The term liberal, in a political sense suggests someone who is “favouring individual liberty, free trade, and moderate political and social reform.” However, to see what the so-called ‘liberals’ are doing in America as of late, is profoundly ‘illiberal’ and extremist. That is to say, they are the antithesis of what they say they are, and have somehow metamorphosed into a totalitarian, authoritarian Marxist political ideology, befitting soviet communism in many ways. We can see this with the coordinated anti-free speech movement of the American socialists within monopoly tech and media companies, and the move further left, with massive censorship and cutting off the voice of millions of people who do not hold extreme leftist political ideals, as well as the attempted destruction of the right for citizens to defend themselves with arms, enshrined in the American constitution. The extreme left of the democratic party, not only wants to destroy the rights of Americans to speak freely, but to destroy their rights to defend themselves with arms, as well as their right to fair election by denying other political ideologies a voice in a free stable level playing field platform where all forms of political ideology and speech are allowed. The democrat party members and offshoots, like ANTIFA and BlackLivesMatter have also advocated violent internal-terroristic action against any other political ideology that does not adhere to their extreme Marxist viewpoint. These people still call themselves ‘liberals’ but to watch them aggressively beating up old frail men at protests who dare to hold up their placards and pepper spraying them in the face is far from any set of defined liberal attitude but one of the the out of control mob. The ‘liberals’ today do not value freedom of expression or speech, they do not value capitalism or democracy, they do not value the right of citizens to defend themselves from harm, they do not believe in individualism, and they do not value nation states controlling borders for security purposes. What we see from today’s American socialists today is a movement that is bolstered by communist ideology, utilising the disenchanted youth, minorities, and illegal migrants to impose their extremist Marxist viewpoint onto everything and everyone in a totalitarian manner. Through violence, aggression, censorship and authoritarian measures, American socialists have soiled their own so-called ‘inclusive’, ‘progressive’ status to become extremists utilising any means possible, legal or illegal to push forward the sovietized programming they have all received. Our observation, form afar, is one out of the box, and is profoundly unbiased as we do not hold any political ideology, left, centre, or right.

It is to be expected, as they do not seem to care that the electorate and grassroots never forget the indignities foisted on them by these pathetic lowly traitors to Britain,” one MP said in parliament. Amongst the so-called Brexiteers in parliament, there has only been mostly silence, and a few whimpers of dissent, otherwise they’re towing the party line, kept in step by the whips, cracking away on their yellow spines. The stench of urine and faeces now permeates the halls of the House of Commons and Lords, as they are a place bereft of democracy, and now completely taken over by the soviet totalitarian forces of the EU, usurping Britain’s sovereign status indefinitely, and enabled by the vile traitors within the wheels of government.'], ['1984 Telescreen: Facebook Portal Device Will Be Compulsory in Every Home', 'We pay for our own chains After stealing the private data of billions of people, and being caught committing many acts of corruption, Facebook wants you to install an Orwellian Facebook Portal telescreen in your home which will follow you around wherever you go. This Facebook device with a camera and listening device may one day have to be installed in every home as a compulsory measure, but for now, it is being introduced as a voluntary purchasable option. Yeah! As if anyone would be mad enough to trust a company that actively accesses users private data, and sells it to any government agency or business that wants it. Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. What kind of a moron would pay for their own surveillance? Well, there are many millennials today, who will no doubt be queuing round the block to purchase this portal, but this is completely understandable because many are vapid, illiterates who know nothing about Orwell, or privacy for that matter. This is why they still keep a Facebook page even after it admitted fully to misusing their private data for profit. The millennials have been conditioned to accept every indignity, to abhor freedom, to abhor privacy, and to obey their master controllers at all cost. Not only do they know what you are thinking these days but they also want to know what you are doing and saying when off the internet, in your own home. The dystopian nightmare we are all living in today, is way worse than George Orwell ever dreamed about whilst writing 1984 in his little Scottish shack. In fact, if Orwell were ever to see the nightmare of today, he would cringe and cry out at its sheer vulgarity and utter disregard for the human soul. For what we have become is part of a hive mind that exists in a cold hard digital shell that infects and probes every part of the human condition, rendering it null and void of any humanity after it has completely enveloped you and exercised its digital wrath upon your very being. It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself – anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offense. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it was called. The tech wizards who are complicit in this tortuous exercise of enslavement are the harbingers of an authoritarian, totalitarian scientific dictatorship, that not only Orwell would have balked at, but add in Bertrand Russell and Aldous Huxley into the mix. Every home will soon have to have a telescreen (Facebook Portal) and you will not be able to escape the prying eyes of your masters as they track your every move online, or your smartphone, or the screen watching and listening to you in your own home. Many today, cannot turn off their smartphones for one second, so it is inevitable that they will soon accept these Facebook Portal devices into their homes as well. It is only a matter of time. He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. To keep your face expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be controlled, with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. No doubt, in the future, if there is a reason for any recall, the authorities will simply be able to pinpoint a thing you said at home, and use that as evidence against you, especially one supposes if you are running for public office or are linked to any business, or lower governmental agency. The courts will be filled with video evidence of whatever crime was committed, and the lead up to that certain crime. If you utter an expletive against the government at home, this will be logged, if you show any form of dissent towards the faction in control, this will be logged as ‘hate speech’ and you will eventually find yourself taken away in the dark hours of the night, never to be seen again. Today, many are caught out by their words on social media, and they have paid the price by losing their jobs, their livelihoods, their family and ultimately their lives. Twitter death can come easily, as you can be arrested and put in a cell in the same afternoon you penned that certain tweet. Suffice to say, anyone who trusts certain nefarious tech companies and what they can do to you are idiots who possibly deserve everything that comes to them. Nineteen Eighty Four was nothing next to the shit that is going on today..nothing.'], ['Richest Football Club Owners in the World', 'F ootball has taken a dramatic twist from being a mere sport for entertainment to become a money making an enterprise. For the past two decades football has become more than a sport, rather it has become a business. It’s not only a business to the club owners but to players as well. The rewards are even bigger than the jackpot prizes on most progressive online slots at top us online casinos. However, the main focus of this article is on football owners who have become rich by investing large chunks of their money into reputable football clubs. Investing in football clubs with a very good history of winning trophies and that generate high profits is what investors look at. Some of these business people invest in a football club due to the fact that they are a long supporter of the club. To appreciate the men behind the so-called successful clubs let’s take a look at some of the richest club owners in the world. Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed AL Nahyan – $34 Billion After taking over the English football club Manchester City in 2008, the club has gone to perform extremely well. Sheikh Mansour has managed to invest his money in signing new players at the club and he also invested in building Manchester City a new training field centre. His ambitions have managed to attract many big name players to play for Manchester City. Since he took over the club has won three League titles and three FA Cups. Sheikh also magnified his investments in buying MLS franchise, New York City and Aussie Club Melbourne City. George Soros – $24 Billion- Manchester United George Soros is the head of the Soros Fund Management one of the most popular hedge funds in the world. Soros became a billionaire in 1992 after he acquired $1 Billion in a single day by trading the British pound during the catastrophic Black Wednesday. He later invested some of his money in football after signing a mega-deal to acquire DC United. He later decided to expand his fortunes and he became a minority shareholder in Manchester United until he became the majority shareholder owner. He has transformed the Red Devils to be dominant in England and in Europe. The club has won many European Cups and Premier leagues under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson.

No one saw him exit the consulate, least his fiancee who was patiently waiting outside. The Saudis conjured up a story that he somehow exited the consulate without being seen by anyone. Was he a practitioner of Ninjistsu, or did he acquire an invisibility blanket a la Harry Potter? The Turks, have another theory, which is much more gruesome, according to a police official, he was “brutally tortured, killed and cut into pieces” inside the consulate after visiting the building on 2 October. Other theories floating about, is that the pieces of meat were taken out in shifts, and sold to nearby kebab shops as lamb. “I just enjoyed a great doner kebab. There was only one problem, I found some identity papers in the kebab written in Arabic, with some Saudi guy on the photo. The kebab was delicious, so I thought nothing of it and put the papers in the bin after I finished my fantastic meal,” an Australian tourist revealed yesterday.

Theresa May, the treacherous liar that she is, drafted the deal with Angela Merkel and Brussels eurocrats on the 5th and 6th of July before she presented to her Cabinet at Chequers on 7 July. Brussels eurocrats know that the deal is already accepted but have conducted the necessary refusals of the contract. May was seen to be sorely disgusted and alone at her treatment by the Brussels mafia on 20 September in Salzburg. This was all a charade. Next up comes Tusk with a declaration that he suddenly wants to do a Canada plus plus super duper deal. Then everything goes quiet. Then, to compound things, Theresa May suddenly starts preparations with her whips to bribe Labour MPs to push her Chequers BRINO plan through parliament bypassing the DUP, and Conservative Brexiteer MPs. May’s superiors in Brussels will seek more capitulations and then will publicly accept the deal which was accepted in July, so May can get the deal pushed through her parliament by using Labour MPs to bypass and betray her own party. This duplicitous machiavellian approach by May not only insults the people who voted to get out of the EU on June 23, 2016, but it insults the sovereign, and Britain’s democratic values. Theresa May campaigned strongly for Remain during the EU Referendum – photo – Twitter Theresa May’s BRINO Chequers plan will tie Britain into the Customs Union indefinitely, and will severely limit the UK doing any trade deals with the rest of the world. During this time, Theresa May has been dishonest, committed treason, lied to the electorate, and misled parliament as well as her own MPs, causing many to leave in disgust. If this is not grounds for her removal, then there is no justice, democracy or sovereignty in Britain today. By pushing through her Chequers BRINO plan through parliament utilising Labour MPs, May is betraying and abusing the electorate and whole system of governmental parliamentary politics with her totalitarian forced ‘Brexit In Name Only’ Brussels penned plan. No Brexiteer will ever vote Conservative again. After this, perversion of the electoral system and debasement of democracy, the Tories will be out of power for thirty to forty years.'], ['Jeez Some Women Are Really Angry These Days', "The rights of women, we fully respect them. If some scumbag abuses a woman, they should get what’s coming to them and then some. The only line we think should not be crossed is if a man is accused of something, then paraded in front of the mob and pronounced guilty without due process. C’mon everyone deserves a right to have their story heard, and by law this is the right thing to do, especially when there have been many documented cases of these vindictive schemers lying about assault, for whatever reason. Men don’t like to see any female hurt in any way, so it kind of smarts when you see some women, who obviously hate men, saying on Twitter or whatever social media site that they want ‘all men killed’. Has it got to that point that a woman would say that? Extreme radicalised soviet feminists are now advocating that all male babies should be killed. No doubt, for thousands of years, women have had the short end of the stick, and have had to endure terrible suffering, however, today in the West, they are pretty much top of the chain. There still needs some work to be done on equal pay, that is granted, but many businesses and institutions are now headed by women. It is in the developing world where work needs to be done to stop the disgusting practice of genital mutilation, and forced marriage, as well as slavery. Why don’t the socialist feminists in the West who hate men so much care about their sisters in the countries where young girls are forced to have their genitals mutilated? The Western feminists do not seem to care, possibly because those other women are predominantly coloured.

Granted many of those filmed were paid workers for Soros affiliated groups, but there were many women present, young and old who followed these manipulative instigators without so much of a question. Women, what have you done to yourselves? You should be celebrating your triumphs. It is young men now who are the downtrodden class, forgotten, left to rot in their misery, suicidal. More young men are committing suicide now than ever before, why is that? Women are now top of university league tables, top of exam results, and employed more than men. Schools and hospitals are primarily run by women, and the UK has its second female prime minister. All commerce is now geared towards the female. Women are succeeding in business, in academics, in all fields, so why is there still so much anguish? We know not all women are bitter radical feminists who want all men murdered in cold blood, but the decent women who are within society should also raise their voices sometimes to stop these deranged radicals once in awhile. This bitterness and hatred must stop."], ['Kavanaugh Win: Communism Takes Step Back in America', 'Saturday was a great day in the fight against communism and Marxism in America when Brett Kavanaugh was instated as a judge at the Supreme Court. The vilification of an innocent man for the purposes of political gain, and the unjust smearing of Brett Kavanaugh should be seen as a national disgrace, and never allowed to happen ever again. This was a great day for America, because it is one step to taking back the country from a political ideology that was practically taking over every governmental institution and every media outlet and has been growing for over eight years under the previous president. Naturally, the hysterical squawking militant communists are now jumping up and down in their soiled diapers, but one day, they may grow up and act like civilised adults, although that is highly unlikely. This was a great day for justice, and for the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law. The communist mobs did not feel that way and tried their hardest to condemn an innocent person without trial or any form of concrete evidence. The highlight of the whole sordid affair was of course Senator Lindsey Graham, who encapsulated much of the disgust we all felt by watching this charade, this sham unfold its ugly wings and present itself to the world. America won! The anti-American commies lost!

The officials said they had never heard of him, and threatened to arrest me.” Since yesterday, French press agency RTF have lost contact with their reporter, who has also disappeared as well as the Interpol president. Interpol has downplayed the concerns, saying the president has little influence over the organisation’s day-to-day operations, which are handled by secretary-general Juergen Stock.

Did you know that those cute fish y’all love called dolphins display disgusting male sexist behaviour? It’s disgusting and we have to stop it. I was speaking to a oceanologist and she told me that it is common practice for young male dolphins to work as a team to separate single female dolphins from their group, take her to a secluded area, and take turns mating with her.” #MeToo activists are now planning to police the waters of the Pacific ocean by patrolling schools of dolphins and if they see that kind of behaviour, will immediately intervene to push the males away and some even advocate a form of punishment towards male dolphins. It’s not just male dolphins that have received the wrath of #MeToo activists, the Bonobo Chimpanzee male displays deeply disturbing sexist traits that have made activists very angry. “We heard that these male Bonobo chimps, they have orgies, this is where they pick any female in the group excluding the alpha female and have sex with them. The female chimps are all submissive and cannot say no, they just fall in line and enjoy the fun. This is one of the most disgusting forms of sexism we have ever heard of. We want to conduct an expedition to the Congo next year where we will intervene and stop this practice if we ever witness it.” However, during the conversation, no one seemed to mention that the male Praying Mantis, shortly after mating with the female, is summarily eaten to provide nutrition for the gestating fertilised eggs or the Latrodectus mactans, i.e. Black Widow female spider usually cannibalises her male mate after he fertilises her eggs.'], ['Cheerful Theresa May Dances Over the Graves of Britons She Has Betrayed', 'How jolly of Theresa May to come out onto the Conservative conference stage dancing like a whacked out robotic scarecrow on PCP?

Anti-democratic betrayal Oh Mrs. May is probably a very pleasant woman to meet in person, but after the smiles, she callously dances on the graves of democratic voters, as well as the graves of those who fought in both world wars to secure Britain’s freedom. All those soldiers and civilians died for nothing if Britain is to be kept prisoner indefinitely to a foreign led Soviet totalitarian entity called the EU. Theresa May’s plan is to keep the UK in the EU Customs Union, and to capitulate to Brussels the ability to forge trade deals with other worldwide nations.

And so they should be since they are now combining to take gambling to a whole new level with VR gaming. Immersive gaming that features virtual reality is the thing that will make the gambling industry even more appealing for newer generations, like the Millennials that don’t consider the traditional casino entertainment to be sufficiently interactive and get their thrills from much more technically evolved games like League of Legends and World of Warcraft. The technology and immersivity that only a VR casino could bring would take things further by making things a lot more social. This is because a user could have a virtual presence and be able to meet and interact with other VR gamers online. This way they could participate in multi-player tournaments and transform a live casino experience and make it even more realistic. At this moment in time there is just one VR casino, but more and better ones are sure to follow as the industry fully develops and the technology becomes cheaper and we learn more know-how. So, what can we expect from VR casinos in the future? Super HD, 3D casino game rooms the best online games recreated in a more realistic manner 3D live tables games, where a player can pick his seat, interact with the dealer, engage with other players and feel like he really is in a real casino the ability to convey body language and gestures and to see those of other players more realistic sounds in-game chats. Once the technology becomes cheaper the only thing that will be left to figure out is how to play casino VR poker and how to hook up the hardware to do it efficiently. Things should be quite easy the more things evolve in the industry. You should be able to just plug in, enter the casino and start playing with no problem. With gambling becoming more realistic there are tons of benefits and just one downside. While an online gambling addiction is quite reduced in online casinos, it might become a little more addictive with VR technology to make it more fun. This is why you should always remember to have fun, don’t do it just for the winnings, and play responsibly.'], ['Triggered Millennials Terrified By Clapping', 'Universities across Britain and the United States are banning any sort of clapping during conferences because it triggers millennials and creates a state of fear. To approve of a speaker, the Millennials have adopted a silent version of showing their approval which involves them waving their hands in the air. “Millennials are in a constant state of fear and anguish, therefore the sound of clapping is now banned in our campus. We have had many students who attempted suicide when previously during a parade on banning yawning, some students accidentally clapped to show their appreciation that someone had stopped yawning. The clapping caused many to cower on the floor and cover their ears and one student even tried to jump out of the window,” campus head, Neil Zozovitch, at Edinburgh University told the BBC. The timid millennials are now fearful of pretty any stimuli whether auditory, olfactory, tactile, or gustation. Permanently offended by all stimuli “One student was offended and would not go out for weeks after a traumatic event in a cinema, he heard the sound of popping corn in the popcorn machine. This highly traumatic event caused the student to have post-traumatic stress disorder, and was confined to a Safe Space for over six weeks before they finally emerged,” Zozovitch added. To have students that are continually offended by everything they see, hear, touch or taste is quite a challenge for university faculty staff. “English literature is a challenge, because millennials are offended by every piece of literature written. Classics like Suetonius are a serious no, no, because reading about what the Roman emperors got up to causes mass trauma. Everything they read is either racist, or sexist, or offends their puerile sensibilities. We even tried giving them Mr. Men books, but they found those highly offensive, sexist, racist and full of gross generalisations that they just could not abide by.” Some universities have now found a wonderful solution to the problem of permanently offended millennial students. “In the morning when they wake up, we give them a blindfold, and ear plugs. They also wear heavy duty gloves so that they are not offended by anything they touch. For breakfast, a tube is inserted in their arm where a drip slowly feeds them necessary vitamins for survival as well as glucose. The students are now very happy, and they can sit in their Safe Space for hours without any trauma.” Now listen to this you sad pathetic whiny thin-skinned soy drinking losers… FULL VOLUME '], ['Boris Johnson the Human — Theresa May the Robot', 'Boris Johnson Much vilified, not only by members of his own party, but by the opposition, Boris Johnson is something of a phenomenon that many cannot understand. Here at the Squib, we understand what is like to be eccentric, to be loud, yet thoughtful, and to be vastly misunderstood. Watching the endearing speech by Mr. Johnson at the Conservative conference, reporting the facts, we see someone who is profoundly human, and who deeply cares for the nation’s well being, especially when it comes to getting shat on by the EU. The news at the moment is that Theresa May has agreed to a complete capitulation of EU regulations regarding the Northern Ireland question, keeping Britain in the Customs Union thus curbing any aspirations of being able to forge any trade deals after her version of non-Brexit is completed. The climbdown by May is fully expected, as she and her Remainer friends never wanted a Brexit in the first place. The notion that the 17.5 million people who voted for Brexit on June 23, 2016 in a valid democratic vote is also sadly false, because the people who voted have been severely betrayed by the treachery of Theresa May and her ilk. Thus, to hear someone like Boris Johnson, tell it how it is, is truly refreshing, and hopefully, there shall be some impetus within the party to oust May, before any more damage is done, not only to the party but to the country. In no uncertain terms, Boris Johnson is a key factor in gaining a clean Brexit, as well as other real Brexiteers who are holding fast under an uncertain storm. There is now a delineation between those false Brexiteers who back May’s non-Brexit Chequers capitulation, and the real Brexiteers who see through the lies and treachery. Theresa May will one day answer to history’s axe, as she will be remembered as the one who sold off Britain’s sovereignty for a pittance to foreign powers intent on hurting these Isles, or maybe she will be forgotten completely, as the real holders of Britain’s destiny took over and helped the nation back on its feet after many years of EU imprisonment.

It was not until 1990 when Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist created the World Wide Web. Unfortunately, the WWW has taken a turn for the worst in recent years as it has been effectively taken over by a few monopoly conglomerates, creating an authoritarian echo chamber only dealing with their view of the world and political beliefs. Effectively, the internet went through three stages to get to the dystopian nightmare we are in now, where users’ privacy has been severely violated, and an authoritarian totalitarian structure covers everything with its noxious cloud of censorship. 3 Stages The beginning of the World Wide Web was a beautiful moment in human history. This was a time when all information irrespective of political affiliation, religion, gender and class was slapped on to the internet. All thought and free speech was thoroughly respected, and anyone could put anything they wanted onto the internet without it being taken down. The internet was thus the New Frontier, and although it had a slight Wild West feel to it, it was free. The next stage was a consolidation period. Large industries like the music industry were losing a lot of revenue through file sharing. Many industries and companies were watching the internet trying to find a way to harness its power, and to milk it for everything it had. This stage of the internet saw the rise of certain companies who were heavily backed by governmental intelligence agencies. Although most information was moving freely, there were signs that this would end shortly and these companies would take over with their regulations. The third and last stage. The EU and its many totalitarian diktats has now become the de-facto regulatory body of the internet along with communist Chinese influence. Freedom of expression irrespective of political belief is near death as massive censorship purges fall across social media sites targeting users and companies who do not hold socialist Marxist values. Users of internet platforms are robbed of their privacy, and their data sold off, or given to clandestine agencies for data farming. Only a few monopoly companies now dominate the internet effectively creating an echo chamber where only their pseudo-Marxist propaganda is allowed. Millions of voices are deleted from the internet, as these unregulated bodies take it upon themselves to create their own skewed dystopian internet nightmare that even George Orwell would have balked at. Suffice to say, this is not the vision that many internet users envisioned to happen to the internet, alas it has, and it is certainly not the vision that Time Berners-Lee had either. Not until 2018, did Mr. Berners-Lee emerge from teaching at MIT, to counter this massive imbalance that exists today on the World Wide Web. His proposal is to circumnavigate the mass governmental, conglomerate soup of authoritarian control, non-privacy, and censorship to wrest back some semblance of a place where people can exchange thoughts in a free manner once again. Inrupt, his company, is working on an open-source project called Solid. SOLID CHANGES THE CURRENT MODEL WHERE USERS HAVE TO HAND OVER PERSONAL DATA TO DIGITAL GIANTS IN EXCHANGE FOR PERCEIVED VALUE. AS WE’VE ALL DISCOVERED, THIS HASN’T BEEN IN OUR BEST INTERESTS. SOLID IS HOW WE EVOLVE THE WEB IN ORDER TO RESTORE BALANCE — BY GIVING EVERY ONE OF US COMPLETE CONTROL OVER DATA, PERSONAL OR NOT, IN A REVOLUTIONARY WAY. The internet today has been hijacked, broken and smeared with the excreta of totalitarianism, internet users, shamefully robbed and used like data cattle within digital prison farms. Thanks to the visionary genius of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, there is still a glimmer of hope for those who value freedom of speech, freedom of art, freedom of thought and freedom to create without the FEAR of persecution.'], ['Exploring the Wonderful Eastern European Music Imports to the UK', 'Since 1997 when Labour won the General Election, and Tony Blair decided to let in over 40 million Eastern European migrants into the UK, things have changed a lot in Britain, not only culturally but musically. If you are unfortunate enough to live in London, most of the language you will hear today is Eastern European. So much so, that many British children are now nearly fluent in most languages from the Balkan countries and Eastern Europe. It is quite normal now for little Johnny, to come home and swear at you in Romanian or Polish, leaving you baffled and slightly concerned. As the High Street has also changed with many Eastern European shops selling their delicious wares of Ogórki kiszone, Pacha (Head cheese, pig’s heads, primarily the ears, legs, genitals and tongue), pickled fruit, and deep fried milt (Romanian dish called Lapti, consists of the sperm of carp, deep fried in batter), so have the British culinary tastes. Not only are most Eastern Europeans, very nice people if you get to know them, they also do have a rather violent streak and little or no sense of humour. It is the taste in music of the everyday Eastern European which does leave a rather bad piquancy to the auditory palate, because wherever you go in London, you will hear their music blaring out, either from their souped up EU registered vehicles, which are immune to any British traffic laws, and are usually uninsured, but the high decibel Balkan Slav rap music can be truly offensive to the ear blaring out from their rented homes and brothels. This sort of noise pollution is a mere symptom of mass unfettered migration, and if you do tell the man/woman gently to turn it down a decibel or two, you are likely to be stabbed violently in the liver. The Eastern Europeans, are however a jolly lot when they get together in the evenings. Where, at one time, it used to be the British tradition to sit in front of the telly on a cold winter’s night watching a show or two before beddy-byes, the Eastern Europeans, usually a double dozen to their room get out the vodka, or whatever tipple they can find, and turn up the music to maximum volume. If you live next door to one of these abodes, be prepared for a very long night as they rarely go to sleep until the early morning, then its off to work for them selling the Big Issue.

Speaking at an impromptu senate meeting on Saturday, Mr Clinton vowed to do the right thing to save the Supreme Court and Senate from even more embarrassment. “I, unlike that other fellow, do not have any skeletons in my closet. I respect women fully, and have been married to my wife for many, many, many, years without any problems. My character regarding any sort of philandering is flawless and I feel I am the right fit for the job in the Supreme Court.” During the meeting, an attractive 18-year-old female intern dropped some papers onto Bill Clinton’s desk he had requested earlier. As she bent over the desk, Clinton’s eyes wandered onto her blouse area, and he went visibly rhubarb coloured, licking his lips with appreciation. One feminist bystander at the meeting was diplomatic when commenting about the display. “I was intrigued to see Bill Clinton looking at that young woman. He drooled over the table top as she dropped the papers down leaning over the desk as he looked into her blouse. He even sniffed her hair as it dropped down across her shoulders and passed her a little piece of paper, winking at the same time. Even though I am a feminist, I am permissive of Bill’s behaviour because he is a Democrat.” Now that the Republican judge, Kavanaugh has effectively been neutered, his life torn apart, and his career blackballed, the Democrats are doing everything they can to install one of their own as Supreme Court Justice. Outside the meeting on Capitol Hill, many Democrat supporters assembled at the news Bill Clinton was putting himself forward as Supreme Justice. Many held placards and sang songs of praise for Clinton and his squeaky clean record. “I’m a survivor! Once about forty years ago, a man asked me out on a date. I still think of that day with absolute disgust. This is how Republican men treat women. They are all trash, and I am so glad Kavanaugh is now eating the dirt he truly deserves. Bill Clinton is so much better than him. He has never done anything bad to women. Hillary is the best too. Yay! Doesn’t socialism rock?” Juanita Broadick, one of the Democrats assembled, told local news reporters at the scene.'], ['In Praise of Senator Lindsey Graham', 'The Washington D.C. swamp Here in the UK, we don’t know much about American senators but we are intrigued nonetheless by a certain chap called Lindsey Graham. What a guy! Amongst the circus politics America finds itself embroiled in these days, senator Graham stole the show and then some during the recent Kavanaugh hearings in the Supreme Court senate fiasco. This is the sort of old world real politics we like to see, a retired former air force colonel who became a South Carolina senator, known as a moderate Republican, however during his speech yesterday he denounced his democrat ‘friends’ for the disgraceful behaviour they have exhibited, and for making American politics look like a despicable sham. Despicable “After watching the Kavanaugh show, all I can say is that the American political system is at the lowest level anyone has ever witnessed. How many million dollars of U.S. taxpayer money was spent bringing this disgusting putrefying piece of stupidity to these senate hearings? I am truly astounded that this was actually brought to any sort of hearing. Discussing teen yearbooks, and accusations made over thirty years in the past from obvious political plants,” a man who has lost hope in U.S. politics revealed. Senator Lindsey Graham, or could it be Jimmy Cagney, gave a good dose of payback that was truly refreshing to watch. He actually personified the disgust many of us felt when watching the hearing. Shameful, and below any metre ever met, it brought up not only bile but anger at how corrupt the system truly is.'], ['Dems Make Grown Man Kavanaugh Cry In Front of Millions of People', 'Watching Judge Kavanaugh blub like a little baby in front of millions of people must be very satisfying for the American socialists who put him in this position. “It was very gratifying to see Judge Kavanaugh die a death by a thousand cuts and have his whole family dragged through the slaughterhouse of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am proud to be a socialist democrat who has condemned a man to death and judged him without trial or evidence,” democrat senator, Johnson Yiarbouk revealed during a 15 minute recess. Debating about words like ‘barf’ and ‘barp’ uttered 36 years ago in a diary, amongst ridiculous accusations that the man is a gang rapist just because some political plant was told to say it. Allegations held for seven weeks then suddenly released is a sure sign of dirty political agendas being set. To see this farce play out with little or no dignity for the senate, one can only think that American politics is totally broken and at a point of no return. The circus continues, with anonymous letters being presented as evidence, a national disgrace ensues, and another example that the democrat party is really scraping the barrel. “Did you drink beer at college?” one democrat senator asks. “Yes, I drank beer,” Kavanaugh replies. “Are you a gang rapist?” another senator asks. “No!” Kavanaugh replies. “But you participated in gang rape orgies and devil worship with Beelzebubba that Tuesday, 36 years ago,” the democrat states without even laughing. Outside the hearing, a former democrat voter said: “This farce just makes people hate the democrats even further. I’m going to vote for Trump in 2020.” '], ['Experts: No Such Thing As ‘No Deal’ it is a ‘Clean Brexit’', 'The doomsayers and fear mongers may have the headlines about a so-called ‘Bad Brexit’ however those with clearer heads think otherwise. The term ‘Bad Brexit’ was created by Remainers and anti-Brexit lobbyists. For Brexiteers however this would be termed as a ‘Clean Brexit’, or simply what most of us voted for, a ‘Brexit’. One must understand that if Brexiteers had been in charge of negotiations, they would have seen the signs early that Brussels was not willing to negotiate in a gentlemanly manner, and would have conducted a Clean Brexit with clinical precision. Unfortunately, Britain was struck by treachery from within and lumped with Remainers in key roles. Clean Brexit What does a ‘Clean Brexit’ mean? Quite simple really, Britain would be out of the EU, trade on WTO rules, and would not pay the EU the full amount that they demand as blood money. Seeing as there would be no deals made with the vindictive petulant EU, the UK would not have to honour anything with them. This is fine with Brexiteers because they simply want to leave. Eventually, EU rules, laws and regulations would be purged from the system, but this would naturally take some time. The UK would go through some period of change, but this would be normal. There is no time in history where a change in system did not have its ups and downs. Britain would lower taxes, not only for business, but for all, including VAT, which is an EU stipulation. Many businesses worldwide would be enticed to Britain with lower corporation and business taxes making it a safe haven within Europe. People would eventually see the costs of their groceries normalising, and their everyday costs for living lowering. Previously, the EU made the price of goods, and clothing increase in price, but when the UK leaves the EU, there will be a substantial drop in costs as many businesses will not be paying the enormous markup costs designated by the EU. Gain our sovereignty back Farming and agriculture would flourish as they would not be held back by ridiculous EU regulations, as would the UK fishing industry when it reclaims British waters, safeguarded by the Royal Navy. There would not be any large payments to Brussels anymore, to be eaten up into a massive black hole spent on extravagant EU projects that only furnish the French or German companies completing them. Neither would British taxpayer money be sucked into the Greek debt hole where money disappears never to be seen again. The UK will not have to join the EU army, which is nothing but an extension of the Third Reich, and neither will we have to take in millions more of EU migrants thus securing our borders and only taking in those who meet the correct criteria. Having a ‘Clean Brexit’ is the ideal solution and would be the best thing for the UK. Once free, Britain can once again forge its own way, sail the high seas and do what Britannia has been doing for thousands of years — out of the EU.'], ['Is Conservatism and Libertarianism the New Punk?', 'These days, anyone who dares to call themselves a conservative or libertarian, are immediately shut down and hounded out of public society. This is why, conservatives and those seeking liberty are the new outcasts, the new punks. Punk, the anti-authoritarian sub-culture came out of nowhere in the 1970s and was a musical genre with a ‘f you’ attitude, and espoused freedom from the chains of establishment authoritarian structures curtailing freedom. Although Punk was left-leaning, anarchistic, it has many similarities to the conservative and libertarian movement today which is fighting an authoritarian media structure that inhibits freedom of speech, censors widely and is totalitarian. To study what is going on today with the shutting down of anything that questions the socialist media entities is in itself dangerous, because algorithms on the internet cannot distinguish social commentary to actual conservative or libertarian dissent. These algorithms were created by socialist tech workers who abhor any political ideology other than socialism, Marxism or communism. American socialist controlled media entities are so stupid they cannot distinguish parody/satire from a hoax. They are so uneducated and ignorant that they label all satire as a hoax. Their algorithms cannot distinguish between satire/parody/rhetoric/irony/pathos/sarcasm because the American tech people are not literate, they know nothing of literature. This is what we’re dealing here with, uneducated, stupid people in charge of large swathes of humans numbering in billions. Conservative and libertarian thought is the new danger, and the new punk. They tried to shut down punk too but that never happened, it was a wild tour de force that came through the scene like a hurricane ripping everything to shreds, including the authoritarian gatekeepers and their anti-free speech, anti-art censorship drive. Eventually, punk became the de-facto genre leading the crowd during its heyday. Socialists (U.S. Democrats, U.K. Labour) and communists are the new parents who send you to your room for listening to Iggy Pop. They’re not fun anymore, they don’t have a sense of humour anymore, and they’re certainly not progressive anymore, they’re regressive, to the days of Stalin, Pol Pot and Chairman Mao. They have turned into miserable, moaning vindictive shisters who use mob rule and censorship to get their little power kicks.

'], ['Think Tank: The West Must Not Let the Horror of Communist China Overcome the Globe', 'The Institute of Western Global Democracy, based in Washington D.C., has revealed a paper on the great danger coming from China, not only its communist political ideology, but its economic means to subjugate democracy through the backdoor. Communist China a Global Threat “What China is doing in Tibet, is indescribable. The horror, the torture of people, the destruction of a whole nation. China wants to take over the world, and it is doing so silently through economic means as well as military. These same methods of discrimination and torture are now being meted out on the Uighur people in Xinjiang province. Millions detained in Chinese gulags and re-education camps, many disappear never to be seen again. “China has been the factory of the West for decades now, and by selling and manufacturing their cheap plastic useless trinkets they have grown economically. This growth has also fuelled their aspirations for global domination, and they have vastly modernised their military and technological capabilities, by stealing secrets from the West and adapting it to their own needs. “Chinese colonisation of many African nations is taking over much of the continent, and taking advantage of respective governments by alluding to help building roads but using its foothold to plunder finite resources across Africa. “Chairman Mao, a cold-blooded murderer, killed over 45 million people in less than four years, this was his Great Leap Forward. His communist ideology has no mercy, and no honour, it is steeped in the blood and bones of millions of innocent men, women and children. This is what the Chinese communist state of today stands for, and they want to not only impose their communist ideals of non-freedom on the internet but on Western democracy. “We see this by the rise in soviet political correctness, which basically is a way of curtailing all speech, as well as mass censorship now prevalent on the internet. This is all because certain companies have been infiltrated by the Chinese and its communist ideology. “The European Union, has also modelled itself on China, and utilises its authoritarian economic muscle as a way to ensure protectionist business practices that benefit only EU companies, mainly those of France and Germany. The Federal Republic of the EU, is a soviet dream that even Gorbachev balked at when he saw it taking shape in the 1980s. “The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.” Mikhail Gorbachev “It is to this effect, that the United States is now fighting back, after suffering for many years with listless, unfair trade deals that benefited only China and the EU. The current president, is bringing manufacturing back to America, something that was laughed at as impossible by the enablers of soviet China in the previous socialist American administration. To have supported such a brutal regime in itself denotes a direct endorsement of brutality. China is further trying to destabilise the West by inundating it with synthetic drugs produced cheaply in Chinese factories. This action creates terrible problems for the population who fall into drug addiction and early death. “It is certainly sad to see how China has shot itself in the foot. To go to any city or town in China, one must first navigate the dirty polluted streets where it is acceptable to defecate in the road, where dogs are slaughtered and eaten, where the air pollution is so bad that people cannot see two yards ahead. People disappear daily in China, the state makes them disappear. All it takes is one single word on the internet, or a neighbour’s report and you’re gone. “This horrific grotesque communist regime in China has imprisoned the people. The ones who are not robots, not indoctrinated in communist ideology from birth, are in serious danger every day. How sad, that there are Western companies who have no conscience and are actively helping the Chinese state through technology to carry out their brutal regime of torture and murder. “The West has a responsibility to save the world from China and its communist rhetoric, as well as its economic warfare. After many years of intransigence and apathy by presidents like Barack Obama, it is crucial that Donald Trump sticks to his guns and defeats the Chinese communist menace, or the whole of Western democracy will be at its mercy. “This will be a hard war, but it is one worth fighting. To fight whole armies of brainwashed robotic communists who do not have a mind of their own, is a foreboding task, but it must be accomplished or they will one day overrun the West.” Amnesty International Human Rights Human Rights Watch'], ['Bodyguard Extravaganza at Labour Conference for Jewish MP', 'The last remaining Jewish MP in the Labour Party after an anti-semitic purge worthy of Stalin and Hitler has taken its toll, arrived at the conference hall this year with a bodyguard troop in tow. “Because of the danger of violence and aggression towards my person as a Jew within the Labour Party, I have been forced to hire over 200 bodyguards for today’s conference. My team are dedicated to stand up for our rights, as Jews, to attend and be members of this party without racist and anti-semitic discrimination,” Gina Horovitz, Labour MP for South Grinstead, told the conference before a number of Momentum members started shouting racist abuse at her. After the brief speech by the Jewish MP, she was rushed off stage by her bodyguards and taken to a secure room where she watched the rest of the conference from a screen. Labour has been embroiled in an anti-semitic argument for months now, as party leader, Jeremy Corbyn was shown to openly support terrorist groups and in no uncertain terms deny the right for Israel and Jews to exist. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn later took the podium to speak about the Jewish question. “Comrades, I have been asked to talk about Jews and Israel (cough). My friends in Hamas, and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade all tell me that I am doing the right thing. They even sent me a complimentary suicide vest so that one day I may use it on myself and become a martyr to the cause. I would like to reiterate to all the press and people who say I am anti-semitic, I say no, I just don’t believe Israel should exist and that all Jews should disappear off the face of the earth.” It may be ok for Jeremy Corbyn, who does not need a bodyguard, but for others, like Jews, the story is very different.'], ['London Primary School Runs Out of Stab Vests', 'Milchen Primary in Croydon, London, has run out of stab vests provided for 230 pupils, the headmistress revealed on a leaflet sent to parents. “We are urging parents to purchase a stab vest for their child, because we cannot supply one to each student.

'], ['Why Europe Should Be Your Next Travel Destination', 'T oday, practically everyone has his or her own #travelgoals. This is why Europe should be the first travel destination. These goals take all forms, and may involve many possible destinations. For many, the most important considerations for a choice of destination are budget, convenience, and perhaps the proximity of the destination. Looking for a place to stay? Yes, most travelers consider that a problem, too. Of course, all of those are pretty important, but if fulfilling real goals are what you want, then maybe you shouldn’t limit yourself too much. (Advanced tip, though. If you’re setting a plan travel to Europe, get Expedia deals. You won’t regret it.) When fulfilling goals, many people tend to forget the need to dream big, and this is true even for travel. People like to settle for ‘less’, contenting themselves with trips that won’t take them too far away, won’t give them experiences that are too new, and basically rob themselves of a trip that just might change their lives forever. While all this might sound overly dramatic, you can’t help but admit that it is true. For the brave and the bold, however, it would really be an excellent idea if you try visiting Europe. True, it might mean spending more than you usually spend, or learning more cultural information than the usual “don’t-talk-when-your-mouth-is-full” sort of rules. A trip to Europe will definitely ask you to leave your comfort zone. But, in a delightful way, a trip to Europe makes it worth the risk, too. Reasons Why You’ll Love Europe Love Europe for its rich historical heritage. What do you think do Socrates, the Roman Coliseum, and a medieval Cathedral have in common? You can probably think of other similarities, but focus on this one for now: they’re all from Europe. And because of that, you can see why Europe somehow screams history. Your visit to each country and city will certainly feel like breathing in the ancients – a treat which you aren’t likely to experience anywhere else. Love Europe for its trains. This is especially lovable if you happen to come from a city or country where, to get to the nearby country, you need to fly. In Europe, you will have the joy of encountering a stark difference in culture and language by simply taking the train to the next destination. And oh, the views are spectacular, too. What this means, then, is that for an hour’s ride on the train, you are basically setting yourself up for a new experience each time. Love Europe for its food. Yes, yes, you can very well that where food is concerned, no other place will ever compare to home. The thing is, nobody’s necessarily disagreeing with you. The point, however, is simply to try out whatever it is that Europe has in store for you, gastronomically speaking. And it’s definitely no small thing, what Europe has to offer. With food options that range from pizza, pasta, breads, seafood, down to warm chocolates, you’ll eventually realize that eating is not a chore in Europe. It’s a full experience. Love Europe for its picturesque cities. You’ve probably had friends and colleagues who have had the opportunity to visit Europe. You’ve probably seen the postcards, heard the stories, and witnessed how their faces lit up while remembering what it felt like to be in European cities. If you try it out for yourself, you’re bound to realize that these cities – Berlin, Barcelona, Florence, Amsterdam, to name a few – are truly beyond the best of your imaginings. Love Europe for its art. Apart from being undeniably picturesque, Europe is also home to countless museums and havens for preserving and nurturing creativity. If you’re the kind of person who breathes in times of fresh inspiration, then without a doubt, Europe is the place for you. If you’re the kind of person who loves music, on the other hand, check out the open parks where free concerts are held by amazing performers. For those who love films, Europe also boasts of parks that feature wide open spaces where you get to watch your favorite movies, too. All in all, it’s impossible not to see how artists and art-loving people will surely find a home (no matter how temporary) in Europe. Conclusion So, it all comes down to this. This might have begun on the note of how going on vacation also means going boldly, especially when it comes to choosing your next destination. However, the discussion has clearly evolved, from simply making bold choices to ultimately presenting you with Europe as THE choice. True enough, choosing Europe will not only give you a vacation worth remembering, but also a vacation you’ll want to have again, and sooner rather than later. In the end, the final decision is in your hands, but of course, with the reasons you’re now armed with, it’s obviously an easy one to make.'], ['New Film: The Silencing of James Woods', 'James Woods is a DS favourite.

That’s what makes James Woods for the Daily Squib staff, a highly respected actor and we feel that his latest film role reveals a world which we hope no one has to ever experience. Erased The film starts where James is a semi-retired actor living in a dystopian world where your every move is tracked, and anything you say can be censored by an extreme leftist authoritarian regime controlling all media and technology. One day, the selfless actor puts something up on a social media site, and his account gets banned. Can you imagine that? A famous but seriously under rated actor who has had so many successes in film being censored because he has different beliefs to the controlling group. But this is the clincher. It’s not just happening to Woods, no, it’s happening to millions of voices, shut down and censored. Disappeared off the face of the planet, never to be seen again. This film depicts a miserable dystopian nightmare world of censorship, tech monopolies abusing their power, and worst of all, election meddling by silencing the views of one particular side of the political spectrum. Based in America, the dystopian world is an insufferable hell that Mr. James Woods is trapped in. This creepy film really gave us the heebie jeebies. We can’t imagine a cold hard world worth living in that bad. Let us hope it never becomes a reality. Will Mr. Woods ever break out and find freedom?

To be polite in the millennial era is now the same as being rude was during previous eras. Data collected included all age groups, genders and race. “Our findings reveal that because of the level of abuse and argumentative conversations we recorded on social media sites, that there was an obvious spill off into the physical world. “In past decades, if a person went up to another and called them names, and denigrated their existence, or was rude and inconsiderate, this would have resulted in a possible physical fight, or a slap round the bonzer. Today, however, there is little or no repercussion when someone insults another online. For most, it is water off a ducks back, but it was still considered rude and impolite behaviour in normal social circles in past eras. Millennials however are more susceptible to triggering, our study found that they were easily ‘triggered’ and could turn abusive and nasty in milliseconds. “We also ascertained that many of the variables included things like an obvious increase in population, mass unfettered migration and ultimately globalism. “Globalism is a necessary economic and political construct and cannot be avoided in this day and age, however our study found that many people were inconsiderate to migrants online, yet offline if confronted by a migrant would generally keep their mouths shut, or leave the area as quickly as possible. These are the same people shouting about migrants online. Was this behaviour cowardice or something else? Well, our study concluded that many indigenous people in the West, when confronted with a migrant in real life, realise that the migrant is as human as they are. “This dehumanising effect of the internet and the lack of reciprocation for ones actions thus enabled us to propose the theory that many who use the internet are cowards and bullies, and they are simply projecting their deepest fears and insecurities onto others, either separated by thousand of miles or within the same country or city. “Certainly, within the last few decades, there has been a major shift in the preponderance to think in an individual manner as opposed to caring about any given group, as was generally prominent in the past. “We further found a serious deterioration of polite social behaviour mainly due to the person’s internet usage. Time allocated to the internet distinctively correlated to how they behaved, from more time resulting in almost schizoid behaviour and perpetual impoliteness, to little time resulting in normal behaviour patterns and politeness. From a median sample, over 67% of participants were a bunch of real ‘arseholes’ and were not only rude online, but offline as well, 20% were simply cowards, and the remaining 13% deemed ‘fearful’. “The centre of life for the millennial generation is now the phone. The cell phone is their existence, and this cut-off from reality is creating, not only rude people, but humans who cannot function without their phones. All in all, this is a very dangerous mix, when it comes to the evolutionary behaviour of the general population. “Our study of the UK, found that British people are now considered rude, when in the past, they used to say ‘sorry’ a lot, and ‘thank you’ and ‘please sir, can I have some more’ that sort of thing. Today, however, the general attitude is to swear, tell someone to ‘F off!’ then get back to the internet and their social media site to pretty much do the same, which denotes a significant shift in public and private behaviour. “Could this be a reason why Britain’s capital city is seeing so many stabbings and shootings?

My superiors in Brussels have told me that I must keep to my guns, and put it through parliament whatever the cost, or I will be punished severely for messing that up, like all the other things I have messed up. “I, as Prime Minister of Britain am confident that the Chequers plan is good, because it means we will keep all EU laws and regulations, and be subject to any future changes made by the EU. “It is vital that it is in the interests of the EU to fashion its rules to benefit producers and manufacturers from the continent, which will thus supersede any UK company. Frankly, I think this is a good thing because UK manufacturers are shit. “Suffice to say, by stringently following the EU rulebook, the UK will be impaired in creating sufficient worldwide trade deals or even negotiate. This is good by me as well, because Angela told me to write it, and I agree with her wholeheartedly. “In addition to the above, the Chequers Plan will prevent the UK from including Mutual Recognition Agreements for goods in trade treaties and this will effectively destroy any chance of any deals with some of our biggest partners, like the USA and Australia. “Yes, we will continue to be a Vichy government to the EU, and have little sovereign value, or democratic value, but I shall continue to lie to everyone by saying I have delivered Brexit as the ‘people’ wanted it. Those ‘people’ reside in Brussels and I have thus completed my job. “You cannot oust me, because for a start, you are weak, a bunch of Brexiteer losers, and you also do not have the fashion sense I have. Boris and Jacob have all bleated to the press that it is not about me leaving the job of PM but of ditching Chequers. Well, I repeat once again, I am Chequers and it is me. I know you won’t dare to rebel against me, because I have the whole EU behind me, the Treasury, the BoE, the Lords, and my extreme left-wing friends the Labour Remoaners. “Ta ta, losers. I won! Hammond, Gove and I will celebrate with a slap up meal of French scallops fished from UK waters by French trawlers at Mark Carney’s mansion on the eve of Brexit, which in reality is a BRINO, as we all very well know.”'], ['Epica Awards Maestro Mark Tungate – An Interview With Creative Insight', 'MARK TUNGATE – SHORT BIO As editorial director of The Epica Awards, Mark hosts the jury, emcees the show and edits the annual Epica Book, as well as writing for our sister site Adforum. He began his career as a local newspaper journalist in the West of England. He subsequently worked in public relations in London before returning to journalism at PR Week, Media International and the French magazine Stratégies, which brought him to Paris. He is the author of seven books about branding and marketing, including Adland: A Global History of Advertising and The Escape Industry: How Iconic and Innovative Brands Built the Travel Business. His articles have appeared in publications ranging from Campaign and Adweek to The Times and the Financial Times. He also writes about the luxury industry for Luxure magazine. He gets up very early in the morning. EPICA AWARDS 2018 – THE INTERVIEW What’s new at this year’s show? Q&A with Mark Tungate, editorial director of The Epica Awards. Q. Epica is back in Amsterdam this year. Why? The obvious answer is that Amsterdam is one of Europe’s most vibrant creative hubs, which is true. But I say that every time. It’s also true that Amsterdam is ideal in terms of logistics: a friendly city, located at the heart of Europe, where everyone speaks English. We have great support there in terms of our local partner, the magazine Adformatie. Plus, the journalists on our jury always enjoy coming to Amsterdam. Even though we give them very little time to party. Q. How do you choose the President of the jury? It’s pretty much an internal discussion among the Epica team. I’m delighted that the President this year will be Tony Chambers, brand and content director of the design magazine Wallpaper*. It’s a magazine I’ve followed for years, but the point is that we’re always looking for leading journalists or publishers who represent creativity and innovation. Tony certainly fits that brief. Q. What makes journalists qualified to judge creativity? Well, don’t forget that many of the journalists on our jury have been writing about creativity all their lives. Some of them have been immersed in the world of advertising, PR or design for far longer than those who actually created the work! So they have an objective, critical approach. This does not make them negative, by the way – in fact, I can tell from the atmosphere in the jury room that they really enjoy looking at the work. Q. What’s new for the awards? New categories? New big prizes? Absolutely. We’ve reintroduced our World Cup category, which comes along every four years, obviously. We’ve also created a new category for Topical & Real Time Advertising, reflecting the 24-hour nature of brand communications. In terms of the Grands Prix, we have a new Responsibility Grand Prix, for cause-related work, and an Alternative Media Grand Prix –because we find that some great work is now almost impossible to categorise. Finally, we have merged the Press and Poster prizes to create a single Print Grand Prix. This enables us to really promote and honour print. As journalists, print is still dear to our hearts. Q. What’s trending among the entries this year? It’s a little early to say, but judging by trends in the industry, I think we can expect more purpose-driven advertising. Most brands seem to accept today that they are more attractive to consumers if they have a commitment to giving back to the world in some way. The creative use of data will continue to be a theme, and perhaps the use of artificial intelligence will begin to make inroads. Q. Will you have a creative conference before the event? Yes, the annual Creative Circle event will take place at the fabulous KIT Royal Tropical Institute, a national heritage building which has for years been devoted to the study of sub-tropical cultures. This year’s theme is “Will Responsibility Kill Creativity?” The format is quite different in that it will take the form of round tables with advertisers, agencies and the media. The idea is to discuss whether respecting sensitivities around gender, inclusivity, diversity and other hot potato issues is discouraging edgy, risk-taking communications. Can you be politically beyond reproach without becoming bland? Q. What can we expect at the awards ceremony? You can expect me in my bow tie, as usual! Actually the ceremony is also held at the Royal Tropical Institute so the setting will be particularly grandiose. We’ll be presenting our first Creative Leaders Tribute to a person who has nurtured and pushed the boundaries of creativity. Every year, we try to celebrate the work while also leaving plenty of time for partying and networking. Since the production company Sizzer are once again fuelling the dancefloor entertainment – and they’re notoriously good at it – we hope to get that balance right. Q. What’s your role at Epica? During the awards season I host the two juries – pre-selection and main –and act as MC at the show. I also host some of our regular showcases. I’m a journalist by training, so a lot of my year is taken up with writing and commissioning our annual book and creating original content for our website. The rest of the time I just sit with my feet on my desk, searching the internet for the world’s best ads. It’s a great job. The creative prize judged by the press is now open for entries.'], ['Jacob Rees-Blogg – Episode One', 'My new Internet blog because tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis. I don’t dislike Europe. In fact, some of my closest friends own homes there. Indeed, I’ve just returned from a holiday on the continent, which was most agreeable. There were, however, some key aspects which only served to confirm that we were absolutely right to Leave. I’ve catalogued these oft overlooked facts below because, as anyone who went to a halfway decent school knows, ex factis jus oritur: Exhibit A: Le petit toilet, j’accuse! The lavatories. This dreadful contraption proved to be hellishly awkward for Mrs Rees-Mogg, our six children, four domestics and myself to use. Without going into the unseemly details, how on earth are you meant to flush it? It’s safe to say I’ve not had as many unfortunate experiences with a loo since my first year at Eton, when I was bog-washed so frequently even my house master used to call me ‘Rees-Bog.’ It should be a source of pride that the Great British Toilet has been flushing away the competition since its conception by the ingenious Thomas Crapper (who my great, great grandfather blackballed for Whites membership due to his unfortunate association with WCs). It still remains a far more effective repository for human waste than this cruelly inefficient European device. Exhibit B: Even in this day and age, Europeans still insist on driving on the wrong side of the road, despite it being considerably more dangerous. I always insist our driver, Stammers, drives in the way God intended, proudly and truly on the left (the only time I’ll ever be seen anywhere near the left, as I often joke to Mrs Rees-Mogg and Nanny!). Stammers cut his teeth in tanks during the Suez Crisis, so he knows a thing or two about driving under pressure. However, even he struggles to maintain an even temper with hot-blooded Europeans hurling unintelligible abuse at family Rees-Mogg, as they hurtle towards us in their perverse direction. As I sat in the passenger seat, working my Rosary and chastising my blubbering children for failing to hold their nerve, I was reminded that we British are not programmed to go with the continental flow; that our resistance to Europe’s extraordinarily arrogant ‘highway code’ was a handy metaphor for Brexit itself. Exhibit C: Just like average people, my six children, wife and I enjoy a sojourn to the beach whilst holidaying in Europe. However, since discovering their inexplicable scarcity to rent on the continent, we have taken to transporting our own bathing machine across the channel from Somerset on a specially constructed raft, thus ensuring my wife and daughter are able to join us boys for a swim. We took no satisfaction in the green-eyed looks shot at us by other bathers, as our machine was hauled across the beach into the sea. In fact, my kind-hearted children, clad in billowing full length costumes, preferred to stay out of sight altogether to avoid provoking more envy. Either way, the fact that these vital facilities are denied to people of less means is a source of genuine sorrow. In addition, by refusing females access to aquatic exercise and the invigorating effects of water, one is likely harming their reproductive potential. It’s inequality such as this that makes Europe the despicably backwards place it is. Shameful. In one’s next Rees-Blogg A long-standing acquaintance recently posted me a VHS tape of a television programme entitled “The Handmaid’s Tale”. It’s been a revelation, so I’ve decided to title my forthcoming Blogg: “Lessons from The Handmaid’s Tale”. Cordially yours, J.W.

Those were the days of loading games with cassettes or massive floppy disks and waiting for minutes on end for it to load up. You would sit there in pure anticipation listening to the quirky garbled sounds of code going through the machine. This time, of course, would give you a few moments to look through the Elite novel that came with the package, which was large and in-depth enough to encompass the enormity of the game itself. Eventually, the game would load up and a big smile would come across your face. Yes, Commander Jameson is ready to start in his Cobra Mk IV. The amazing thing about Elite, whether played on the BBC Micro, or Acorn Electron, was for those days in 1984, the game was vast. There were whole universes to explore, Thargoids to blow you up in Witch Space, and fortunes to be made in trading routes all crammed into 22k of memory. For a child, this opened up massive avenues, as you built everything up from nothing to equip your ship better, and to shoot down as many pirates as you could to increase your rank up to Elite. The architects of this seminal game in gaming history were two Cambridge university undergraduate mathematicians. David Braben and Ian Bell, who somehow slapped multiple galaxies, ships, space stations, combat dynamics, and trading into an 8-bit computer. Written in assembly language and machine code, the coding had to be very succinct to fit everything into a few bytes. At the time, wireframe games were exclusive to arcades, where you would have to plonk in your ten penny piece, but to have a wireframe game in your own home to play at leisure was a real kicker. If you weren’t hooked after your first docking at a Corialis station, then you were effectively dead behind the eyes. Elite Dangerous Turn to 2012 and a Kickstarter campaign to develop the mother of all versions for Elite, i.e. Elite Dangerous. David Braben, was back and this time with new technology that would involve an immense jump into the year 3300. For old hands, this was a dream come true, and to see the game come to life with a plethora of upgrades was astounding. Of course, with a game of this size, there had to be teething problems but the attention to detail, and mechanics incorporating actual elements of space travel was mind boggling. 400 billion star systems Frontier Developments thus created a whole new world, where many dynamic elements, and strategy would give the player real impetus to succeed. For beginners, you start off in a Sidewinder, and a little cash to get you going. That’s it, survive or die. You can progress multiple ways, either trading, combat, piracy, prospecting, exploring, or whatever system you can find that is out there. Opportunities always come up. The Elite Dangerous universe is made up of many factions, so politics is a real game mechanic, and in additional game add-ons like Horizons, you can land on planets. Fitting out your ship with regular systems is not good enough, eventually you will have to endear yourself with an engineer, and for that you will need materials. Each engineer deals in different ship systems, so there is a seemingly never ending series of tasks to complete. The thing about Elite Dangerous is that you need dedicated gamers to play it, because many who have no ability to concentrate, or have a low attention span give up easily. Elite is like real life, if you don’t stick to your guns, you don’t survive. Some say, there is a grind element to Elite, but this is what makes it so realistic. Unlike other games where rewards are dished out every minute, Elite takes years of playing. This is why it is possibly the best space game out there, or openworld game that has ever existed. The Frontier Developments team are continuously bringing out new updates and patches, so the game as a whole grows, especially the following of the game, and the multiple forums and videos of how to do things in Elite Dangerous. In 1984, it was fun to fly up behind a lumbering Anaconda and blast it to shreds with your Cobra, but in 2018, good luck mate. A Cobra up against a fully armed, and engineered Anaconda has no chance. Anyway, the DS Team is off to a Haz Rez for some serious pew pew.'], ['Amazon Workers to Have Wheels Embedded in Their Feet', 'Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, does not do things in half measures. The Amazon boss, not only planned to put employees in cages for warehouse work, but has gone one step further, by applying for a patent to have wheels surgically embedded into the soles of Amazon workers’ feet. “Amazon has excelled in technical excellence and efficiency in its workers, however we feel the conversion rate of maximal productivity within the workforce can be increased by 350% when workers undergo the wheel procedure,” an Amazon spokesman revealed, Monday. The detailed plan for surgical implantation of the wheels reveal that many of the employees will not have to actually think where to go. According to Amazon, it takes 6 seconds for an employee to look at a schedule and think about where they have to go to get a package. By shaving off six seconds on each pickup or drop, the company would save over $10 Billion per annum. Powered by brushless motors, employees in Amazon warehouses will have the ability to travel at speeds of 26 MPH, depending on how urgent a package schedule is required. The speed and destination of the wheeled employee will also be strictly regulated, and the employee will not be able to control the device themselves. Assuring warehouse staff, Bezos revealed that the surgical procedure will be painless, and will involve implanting the wheels into the soles of the feet with a microprocessor implant linked from the spine up into the brain. “You won’t have to think, because the wheels will take you wherever we want and all you have to do is pickup or drop the product. The microprocessor is very powerful state of the art equipment and will guide each employee on what they have to do. Employees will not even have to wear shoes.” Another bone of contention with Amazon bosses is the amount of toilet breaks an employee can have. This time lost is also deemed a loss in productivity, therefore each employee will be given special bags that will be fitted into their urinary tract, as well as rectum. “You want to take a shit, or piss, just do it. You could be holding a Barbie doll for some little girl’s present but she won’t know you just took a walloping big shit, and pee at the same time. You just shaved off six minutes of productivity time lost and not only that, you can do it whilst travelling at 15 MPH.” According to the Amazon schedule, the wheel implant codex will be implemented in January 2019, just in time for the post Christmas sales season.

From this crack in the earth, lava shall pour out and then from the skies there shall be locusts, big fucking locusts, each the size of an Audi Quattro, and they shall descend onto the population and crops in their millions stripping Britain of everything valuable. “Then on the second day of No Deal Brexit, a trumpet will sound from the heavens and lava will spew out of massive holes in the earth and cover the land in hellfire. There shall be rivers of blood as all of Britain’s rivers will fill up with…er..blood. And on that day, a volcano will emerge from the Houses of Parliament covering the area with black clouds and hot lava. “On the third day of No Brexit, Britain’s population will realise their house prices are so low that they are now deemed worthless, that is if there are any people left alive, and the pestilence will have spread across the land killing and maiming the one’s still standing. “On the fourth day…etc etc..”'], ['Russian Novichok Tourists Enjoyed Britain’s Sights', 'Leaving a trail of death behind them wherever they went, Russian Novichok tourists, Ruslan Boshirov, and Alexander Petrov, said they enjoyed the sights and sounds of Britain as they holidayed around a few cities. “We especially enjoyed the London sights, despite the high crime rate, we were strangely not affected because many people would just drop off and die as we walked past anyway. Some might say, we’re doing the work of the London Mayor,” Petrov said aloofly. Petrov’s partner, Boshirov, was keen to see the Salisbury cathedral, because of its spire, and old cock. “We awakened early in the morning from bed together in our East London hotel room, then travelled to Salisbury, and the rest is history. It’s all over the news. I don’t have to talk about it anymore,” Boshirov said. The couple, plan to adopt a baby from one of the many squalid Russian orphanages in October, and are keen to see the sights of Europe before they settle down to life with their new baby in their gay family unit. “After landing at Gatwick, the customs man said ‘Anything to declare?’ and we just ignored him and walked through. When I looked back, he was lying on the floor with white foam coming out of his mouth. “London is such a fabulous city. We went up the London Eye, and later on Petrov took me up the jack’s-ie. After a romantic traditional Russian dinner of plain boiled potatoes, boiled cabbage, and boiled cabbage dessert with boiled water, we retired to our hotel bed,” Boshirov revealed sashaying along the corridor flamboyantly. Whatever is said about these two men in the press, they sure are an entertaining couple of fellas.'], ['The Question No One is Asking – Why Was it So Easy to Smuggle Novichok Through British Airport Customs', 'It is all well and good watching the farcical RT interview with the suspected Skripal poisoning operatives, two fellows with fake names from Russia, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Borishov, but the real question should be: Why was it so damn easy to smuggle a deadly nerve agent like Novichok through a British airport? This question leads us to the fact that British customs is practically useless, if one can easily smuggle in a deadly chemical substance in a fake perfume bottle. From the demeanour of the two Russian agents, it is all too clear that there is more to the story. During the interview, the two suspects refused to answer questions about their business and their location, they refused to show their passports to the camera, and they did not reveal who they really are and their real purpose to visit England, apart some obvious baloney about visiting Salisbury cathedral. No doubt, the agencies tracking these two Russian agents know a lot more than they are revealing to the press, and maybe in time, more will be revealed. As for the Novichok coming through British airports, this is an even more worrying question that needs to be addressed, as of yet, no one but the DS is asking it. What this means in effect is that deadly nerve agents for use in terrorism can easily be smuggled into Britain. The Russians who perpetrated the Skripal murder attempt which also resulted in innocent civilian deaths, will have effectively advertised the fact to other terror organisations on how easy it is to smuggle these deadly agents through customs. One can only hope that the customs service in British airports, and anti-terror agencies step up their methods in detecting such an obvious oversight. Next time you’re in a plane, the person next to you could have a bottle of Novichok in their hand luggage or on them, it really seems to be that easy to smuggle through airports.'], ['When Socialism Goes Very Wrong – Targeting Innocent Children', 'To see such a vile nasty old ‘Class War’ activist telling MP Jacob Rees-Mogg’s children off about their father, and leering at them is not only unsettling but a sign that socialism in the UK has gone so far to the left, there is little distinction to militant Marxism. Labour must be very proud, because not only are they anti-semitic but their kind now target innocent children of politicians. This disgusting event was played out in front of the cameras for all to see, and no one stepped in to stop the abhorrent vulgar old man from going on and on towards the children of Mogg, least the policeman standing around looking smug and happy with himself. These are the sick tactics now employed by socialists, who in opposition, are turning nastier each day, not only here in the UK, but across the pond. They seem to be digging themselves into deeper holes every time they open their filthy mouths.

The DS warned this day would be coming in 2015 but no one cared then or was listening. They might wake up soon, hopefully. HUDSON: GAME OVER MAN! Look at it this way, the EU already tried this experiment in Spain in 2015. By introducing a link tax on Google news in the country, many smaller publishers went out of business, and Google finding the whole debacle unmanageable simply pulled out of Spain. Traffic dropped drastically. Google has not been back since. The same thing will happen across the whole internet if this tyrannical censorious law goes through in January. Many regions outside the EU will simply block any traffic from Europe. The recent GDPR directive by the EU has already damaged the internet because many US publishers did not want to deal with its complicated and costly implementation, they just blocked all traffic from Europe. The blocks are still in place as of writing, over four months after EU enforcement. Article 13 is not about artist or creator rights, it is about shutting down speech on the internet from unsanctioned voices. The EU is using the pretence of protective copyrights of European content creators to effectively silence the voices of alternative media establishments who are immune to mainstream media lies. People want their alternative voices heard, they want something other than state sanctioned echo chambers spouting out the same propaganda day in day out. Tim Berners-Lee, where are you now? You were the engineer of the World Wide Web, and you have vehemently opposed this EU directive that will silence whole swathes of the internet and create a dystopian Orwellian slush pit of shit. For those who hold the torch of freedom, of justice and liberty, we will have to look elsewhere for our utopian dream as sadly the internet will never be the same again. We will not be able to create freely and without punishment, we will not be able to innovate and reach the outer boundaries of human thought, we will not be able to philosophise without being shut down by the faceless EU bureaucrats and unelected officials who have brought upon the internet this hideous pestilence of over-regulation and dictatorship. As George Soros laughs into his broth concocted from the marrow of dead babies harvested from Chinese hospitals, and Obama chuckles away at another great effort from his beloved EU, we can only think of the great mediator called death. Hasn’t Paul McCartney got enough money already? Death mediates all things, and these people who engineered their evil plans will one day die, just like everyone and everything dies at some time, even the fucking EU.'], ['Why Caricatures of Certain People Are Not Allowed Anymore', 'A tennis player The definition in the dictionary of a caricature is: a picture, description, or imitation of a person in which certain striking characteristics are exaggerated in order to create a comic or grotesque effect. In today’s media, any caricature, or satire of a black person is deemed as racist under politically correct diktats enforced by the controllers. It is fine for a cartoonist to draw the exaggerated features of a white man, or pretty much any other race, but to draw a caricature of a black person is now completely illegal, and can result in banning, censorship and eventual loss of employment. This is why, cartoonists like an Australian caricaturist have now been banned by Twitter. Currently, all forms of satire or cartoons could become banned on the internet and media, because they deal in caricature, in ridicule of the ridiculous, and in the ultimate truth. To have one section of an ethnic group exempt from caricature, is a form of reverse racism, and is racist in itself, however the controllers cannot see this fact from behind their idealogical political haze. To even mention that certain ethnic groups of people have big lips, or a certain type of hair is deemed as racist, however the caricaturist sees what he sees, and exaggerates it — like, that’s their fucking job. If a female tennis player expects to win every match she plays simply because of the colour of her skin, and when she is losing, acts out a temper tantrum, in the long run, this is not acceptable behaviour in a civilised society. She will no doubt cite racism as the fact that she lost, when the blame is entirely upon herself and her unjustly entitled behaviour. Furthermore, to then divert the loss of a tennis match onto a cartoonist who witnessed her grotesque behaviour and entitled attitude, is a terrible injustice, and metes out punishment to the wrong person. Today, satire and the art of caricature are in grave danger, and this signals that Western society is moving towards tyranny through censorship. Our Western ideals of democracy are now in the past, and we are witnessing a time of communistic censorship more akin to the Chinese Communist state, than Western democracy. In history, throughout fascist and communist rule, satire and caricature, all forms of parody, were banned unless they conformed to demonising the enemy of the state. Most practitioners of real satire had to either go underground, or plant very subtle satirical gems in their work to continue doing their art. We are now seeing this form of tyranny today, this Orwellian tyrannical censorship, and unless something is done to bring back the democratic rights of free speech, expression and creativity, it will be lost forever. The upcoming EU directive, Article 13, will no doubt increase the censorious tyranny, and all parody, satire, caricature will be subject to removal.'], ['The End is Nigh For Theresa May', 'As the members of the ERG sit down to discuss the ongoing farce of Mrs May’s cataclysmic dedication to the Chequers BRINO (Brexit In Name Only) plan, there is a feeling of slight apprehension within the grand hall, but this apprehension is also tempered with purpose. Saving Britain once and for all from the omnipresent clutches of the EU and forging our own way in business and law is a must, it is part of Britain’s makeup and has served this land for thousands of years. Britain cannot be subservient to Brussels for much longer, and if May has her way, she will tie Britain in with the EU forever, and put us in a very bad position. The overall plan is to submit letters to the 1922 Committee and oust May as PM, thus triggering a leadership contest after the current PM is eliminated with a no confidence vote. The key to ousting May will be in timing. In any event like this, timing is a crucial factor and many know that in parliament, events can suddenly shift and change at the drop of a hat, leaving key decision makers to act there and then or lose the opportunity forever. The numbers of MPs who are against May’s Chequers sham are numerous, and some are even saying it is worse than the Poll Tax, which downed Mrs Thatcher all those years ago. The Tory Brexiteers have the numbers, but May is planning on using Labour to push through her nefarious Chequers plan, and consorting with the oppositional enemy to lock Britain in with the EU forever. Before the Chequers meeting where she announced her BRINO plan, May had met Merkel and the German Chancellor dictated the draft paper to the British PM. This is in effect was collusion with a foreign government to create a plan to surrender the UK to the EU through the backdoor, and one could argue, treason against Britain and the sovereign. With a Tory conference coming up, Theresa May will probably not survive till then, and if she does, she will be met with derision, hissing and booing, not only from Tory grassroots but from the thousands who detest her Chequers plan, and her insipid stalling of Brexit, which has led Britain into a quagmire of detritus that stinks to high heaven. The Number 10 revolt is now on, and the plan is set in stone. Within a few days, weeks, there will be real action, and the mantle of Brexit shall be put in the hands of real Brexiteers like Mogg, and Johnson.

In a remarkable u-turn, the royal palace is arranging for Thomas Markle, the outspoken loudmouth dad of Meghan, to move into Kensington Palace next summer. “We have spoken with the gentleman, when we could get a word in edgeways. We offered him a room in a shed adjacent to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s cottage within the grounds. The father has agreed to behave himself and will only invite the other ‘white trash‘ relatives at weekends,” Theo Spicer, a royal attache revealed today. The overjoyed father of Meghan was said to be ecstatic and ordered up numerous photoshoots with tabloid newspapers, and pizzas to celebrate his good fortune. “I cannot wait to be inviterated to all the British royalty events and I wanna speak with that big eared dude, Prince Charlie fella, and give that old coot Prince Philip a lesson in good ol’ American manners. These Limeys sure know how to hold events, we’re talkin’ free booze, food and I get to stand on the red carpet.

If he ain’t sorry Harry but gots to get the belt out, whack a doodle do! I gotta check up on them some and encouragify the two to start making babies soon as well.

Oh, and I bought one of my girlfriends a $790,000 diamond necklace, and she didn’t like it, so I had to throw it in the garbage. These are the hardships I find living in America. I ain’t going to stand for the National Anthem because I feel hard done by. I gots me some principles!” For every game, Johnsons, a line backer for the Douche Beggars, now lies down on his back or kneels in protest at the sheer injustice he feels every time his bank balance increases. Injustice “In America today there is a lot of injustice. Look at my neighbour, he plays for another team and earns $6 million more than me, and he’s black like me. That makes me outraged. Plus he’s only a wingback. Last year I only made $86 million, and that’s not including all the sponsorship deals, but I still feel slighted. Imma angry. The white devil did this, and he gonna pay!” Hardship The hardship these NFL players have to deal with every day of their lives must make life excruciating. Can you imagine driving your off the factory Lamborghini Aventador SVG coupe to the local liquor store, when it goes over a bump, it jolts the car, maybe slightly scratching the lower bump guard? I would feel angry too. It’s just so unfair. I mean the NFL life is full of hardship, and compared to the hardships of some soldier stuck in a mud pit, his buddy’s legless corpse next to him, soaking in the rain while Japanese artillery falls down all around, it’s a no brainer frankly. Those soldiers who were severely injured in the two world wars, or died, they don’t deserve the same respect as a multimillion dollar earning NFL player. Keep kneeling and disrespecting the American flags folks, sure, you’re doing the right thing.'], ['Be Ready – Milan Fashion Week SS/19', 'S hot to celebrate Milan Fashion Week SS/19 (18-24 September, 2018), Be Ready sees Ukrainian model Nastya Timos determined to be in top shape for the upcoming Milanese season.

The irony is, Alex Jones now gets to live amongst the rich tech crowd, but he’s on the streets and they’re in their multi-million dollar mansions and apartments. “I get to see Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter every day, and he gave me a dollar. I tries to sell him some Brainforce I cobbled up with some dry leaves, some used needles and a piece of prime San Fran human faeces, but the guy refused me. He just hurried along and threw me a dollar,” Jones shouts loudly at a street sign. Since being deleted from the internet, Infowars has sadly been shut down, and the whole crew disassembled. Some made it to California to Skid Row, others tried to stay in Texas but the streets there are not as forgiving as they are in liberal strongholds. “We got deleted. Traffic stopped. Trump did nothing to help us. End of story. Hey, is that a tuna sandwich? (pointing to a wrapped up object nestled in a bin).” Now that America has been taken over by the ‘ChiComms’ Mr Jones has sadly been left behind. Unlike a good commie, he didn’t take the lucrative brown envelopes handed over by Chinese state funded media companies to American media conglomerates but tried to go the route of freedom, truth and the American way. “There is no Paul Revere here on the streets. Sure I have freedom, but no food, no clean water or a place to sleep. This is the price I paid for speaking the truth, and you know what happens when someone speaks the truth in a dishonest corrupt system. You get the boot sooner or later.” The homeless charity gives Alex Jones a blanket and some clean syringes. It’s going to be another cold night on the unforgiving alleyways of San Francisco. Better shoot up now so you don’t feel the cold so much and dream about the good ol’ days of preaching freedom to the fans now long gone and forgotten.'], ['Lord Haw Haw Hammond to Punish Brits With Nasty Budget', 'Speaking from his bunker deep in the Treasury, the Remoaner, Lord Haw Haw Hammond broadcasted that he is delighted with the punishment budget he will unleash across the whole of Britain.

It’s because you people <spitting> still do not capitulate to our masters in Brussels. I was planted into this high position by our Remainer Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Remainer led Cabinet. I am justified in punishing you British swine for your indiscretions. Haw, haw, haw, haw!” Many Brits who are already struggling under the regime of a Remainer-led Cabinet were naturally defiant about Lord Haw Haw Hammond’s punishment budget. “They can punish us as much as they want. They can have as many referendums as they want, we will not surrender, we will fight from the hill tops, we will fight from the beaches, we will fight from the city centres, we will fight from the Tesco car parks, we will never surrender to Brussels or to Lord Haw Haw Hammond and his vindictive spiteful taunts,” Reggie Churchill, 35, from Kent told local news services.'], ['Trump Sinking Into White House Swamp', 'Here’s a guy who said he would clean out the swamp when he became president. Well, good luck with that because at the moment the Teflon Don has both legs sinking in the swamp and is already up to his waist in it. With news that there are saboteurs all around the prez in the White House sabotaging his every move, who is left to trust? “The Don brings in one guy, fires them the next day, then brings in another guy, and fires them the next day. He is surrounded by sycophants, yes men, and they are all writing books, taping his conversations, serialising their stories in the New York Times, what’s next? Maybe a Netflix series, House of Swamps?” one White House insider revealed. The sad truth is that sure Trump is tough and knows business, but is he this blind that he can’t sniff out the snitches amongst the White House crew? How about getting some trusted secret agents to actually do their job and turf these rats out of the building? “Trump needs to trust the people around him. I say waterboard the fuckers. If they don’t confess who they’re really working for, move on to fingernails, or sit them in front of a nude photograph of Nancy Pelosi for twenty minutes till they crack. There has to be a way to stop these snitches,” another White House insider revealed. The infiltration is so thick in the air, you could cut it with a knife, and it is not going to stop there, it keeps going on and on relentlessly, with every news story published in the daily news reports. Can this stuff be categorised as espionage, or treason? Well, hell yeah! This is what Trump should be doing, he needs to put these people in the stockade, and throw away the key for thirty or forty years. Do these people not sign disclosure forms before they start employment? One would think this is a requirement in the White House. Whatever happens now, Trump is being made to look like a blind fool, he even has papers taken off his desk without him realising, and key policy decisions skewed by his so-called ‘assistants’. Wake up Mr Magoo, and get with the program. The whole place is laughing at you behind your back. They probably pin ‘Kick Me!’ notes on the back of your jacket when you’re not looking. '], ['Social Media Censorship: The Jews Had Ghettos Now the Internet Has Them Too', 'What the so-called ‘liberal’ social media companies are doing today is reminiscent of what the German Nazis did to the Jews in Poland and Germany by putting them in ghettos away from the rest of the population. Liberals are meant to be inclusive, they are meant to be tolerant of other views, they are meant to be progressive, and innovative, creative. What we have now is a tyranny, we have people who have thrown away liberal values for authoritarian, totalitarian tyrannical values reminiscent of the Nazis during World War II and their treatment of the Jews. In the 1940s, the Nazis created Jewish ghettos to keep Jews away from the ‘pure’ Christian Aryan populace, the mere sight of a Jew offended their sensibilities, and their Christian religion. Jews were thus stuck in rat filled buildings, overworked, starved and their businesses confiscated. Their voices were stamped out, much like the voices stamped out by social media companies today. The new Jews of today on the internet are those who have alternate views to the so-called inclusive liberals. If your view is not the same as theirs, you are immediately put upon by the ‘liberal’ mob, judged, reported, then silenced by the social media companies and consigned without trial or reason to the internet ghetto. In essence there is now a license where it is okay to be bigoted to the so-called bigots, where if anyone is offended by another person they have a right to shut them down without discourse, without a simple conversation or discussion. Anyone who does not have the liberal point of view is labelled a Fascist, yet the liberals themselves are acting like Fascists themselves. The liberal sensibility of inclusivity does not extend to anyone who offers a different or varying viewpoint, it is just shut down, no mercy, no thought on how other humans may have differing viewpoints within the population, no allowances. This mob rule is very similar to what was happening in Nazi Germany during the 1940s towards the Jews, used as scapegoats and reviled by the establishment and people. Today, Libertarians and Conservatives are the new Jews, and anyone who does not fall into those ideological boxes, who differ to liberal politics, are also included. The question is, why have the former-liberals strayed from their inclusive path so much, and if they are not liberals anymore, what are they? The former-liberals are now acting like Fascist Nazis, or Bolshevik Communists, each have their own totalitarian message of anti-free speech, mass censorship, tyranny, either sending people to ghettos or gulags. It is truly sad to see where former-liberals have gone, and they somehow do not see it for themselves. One supposes that they are so blinded by their rage, and hatred that they have been indoctrinated to a point of blindness and no return. No more social capital This internet ghettoisation is possibly due to in part to the breakdown of social structures within communities over the past decades, and the internet culture of individualism taking over, where people do not meet face to face any more, and prefer to converse on forums like social media sites, which in effect, are anti-social because they have no social reality, no social capital, or human understanding within the cold hard unforgiving digital walls. It is now easier to simply delete a person from internet existence then to actually have a conversation with them on a human to human level. If humans talked more face to face, much of what is going on today would not be happening. The Millennial ‘Safe Space’ is now a tyrannical platform where people with differing thoughts and ideas are pilloried for their viewpoints, shamed publicly and then condemned without trial to an internet ghetto of censorship and silence. One can only feel pity and shame towards the former-liberals, whether they run social media sites, or are part of the baying mob who single out individuals for mob justice, these people have lost their liberal status and are now part of a tyranny that is very much like what the Nazis did by putting Jews into ghettos. There is very little difference, the internet ghetto or the Warsaw ghetto…very little difference. The internet was meant to bring humans together as one, instead, because of censorship and tyranny, we now are living in a ghettoised polarised internet dystopian nightmare created by former-liberals, now reminiscent of Nazis. Shame on you former-liberals, shame on you, what have you become?'], ['How to Market Your Product Online and Skyrocket Your Sales', 'O nline marketing isn’t as easy as simply promoting your product on a few social media sites. It’s not about SEO only as well – it requires quite a few digital skills if you want to market your product and raise your sales. It’s a pretty complex process which is why most companies pay professionals in digital marketing services agencies to do it. It’s the best way to go if you have a product that is interesting, but you simply can’t break through to the surface. If you’re an average entrepreneur and don’t have a small fortune to spend on digital marketing, there are a few things you can do to promote your product for free and make your first sale. A first sale is symbolic and necessary as well – it will make you more optimistic and it may be the major turning point for your business. Anyone with common digital knowledge can promote their product online without paying big companies to do it for them – you just need to do a bit of research and try it on your own before you decide to spend thousands. Blogging Blogs are a perfect option for promoting your product online. They’re free, they can reach a vast audience, and most importantly, they can increase your sales. It’s a perfect platform for your marketing efforts that can automate your sales and bring you a nice income. It needs time though – you need to fill your blog with quality content before everything kicks into action. Months may pass, but if you’re willing to try, it will pay off in the end. Social Media Social media is probably the easiest and best way to get the word out for your product. It’s a low-cost option that will make users engage with your product or services and hopefully buy your product. However, you need to target the right audience and reach out to influencers as well, as they’re the right kind of person that can promote your product. Still, social media is the right way to go, as there are thousands of buyers that you can turn to regular customers. E-mail Lists E-mail lists sound so 1996, but they’re a great and cheap method that can promote your product to thousands or even millions of people. First, though, you’ll need to attract the right customers to your website and woo them so they sign-up on your e-mail list. Once they do, you’ll need to constantly remind them of the services and products you’re trying to sell while also sharing useful information on a regular basis. E-mail marketing won’t help overnight, but it can significantly boost your sales. Affiliate Marketing Affiliate marketing is one of the most cost-effective ways of promoting your product online. Creating a proper marketing affiliate program can increase traffic to your website and rank it higher in search engine results. Of course, you’ll need to pay a commission to bigger affiliates who can bring more customers to your website. If you’re an online retailer, affiliate marketing is an amazing channel for your products that can bring you a steady income every month.'], ['Making It Through One Day in Sadiq Khan’s Violent London', 'If you want to live, avoid public transport. On London’s bus, and train network, stabbings and shootings are now so numerous that the press are simply ignoring the sheer number of reports. Public transport in London is not only perilous but suicidal, even if one has a personal entourage of bodyguards, and are dressed in heavy Kevlar vests, you still run the risk of early death. We made our way from Alexandra Palace to Wimbledon leaving at 5am. The convoy of armoured cars were specially brought in from a manufacturer of military vehicles in Stuttgart, Germany. In each vehicle we had arranged for a security team of ex-military operatives who were trained well in counter terrorist measures, and were armed to the teeth. Since living in London, we have not seen anything of this level in crime and violence, where every day there are numerous reports of fatalities even though the press reports are gagged by the Labour Mayor’s office. Driving through the streets, Bagram Dave, an ex-SAS chap tells me to duck, as shots crack into the car’s armour plates. Apparently we are now being followed by an Eastern European gang on mopeds who have spied our expensive looking vehicles. One of the masked men on mopeds comes up to my window shouting for us to pull over. Instead, our driver hammers his foot on the accelerator pedal and the assailants are left in the dust. Had we been in a normal vehicle with no bullet proofing, we most probably would be dead by now. The streets of East Finchley are strangely quiet despite the roaming gangs and hoodies looking for targets. The reason for my journey to South London is I want to visit an old auntie of mine, she is 94, despite her age, sprightly, but living in abject fear due to the rise in violence. We will bring her some valuable vittles then make our way back over the river. Our convoy crosses into Hampstead. Once an affluent area, it is now a crime ridden shit hole where social housing has blighted much of the neighbourhood. There are no police anymore, and the gangs are free to commit their crimes with impunity. Stopping at traffic lights, I see that our crew is nervous. Suddenly, out of the darkness four hoodies surround our vehicle armed with zombie knives and machetes. They shout through the closed windows and demand we exit our vehicle turning over our valuables. Luckily Team B behind us are alerted to this and exit their vehicles with their licensed sub-machine guns aloft. They shoot a canister of tear gas at the gang who kick it away laughing before trying to slash our tyres. Our vehicle tyres include a specialised rubber constructed out of a formulated light, high strength compound made to resist crack propagation via ballistic invasion and severe road risks. In other words, these things are designed to run even when slashed or shot up, with little loss of stability. Team B fires a warning shot across the gang’s quarter but they don’t flinch, instead they rush forward with a battle cry raising their knives in the air simulating stabbing motions. They are probably high on Skunk weed or some sort of synthetic drug. “Neutralise!” shouts our commander, as the team shoots each assailant first in the kneecaps, then double taps to the cranium. It’s only 7am now and seeing steamy brains glistening in the gutter makes me wretch. It looks like a greasy spoon stop will have to be put off for now. We move on leaving the bodies behind. Will the convoy make it to South London safely and in time for High Tea? Check back next week for the conclusion.'], ['Think Tank: Fighting Racism is Actually Racist', 'When one fights racism, this fight singles out whichever race is being persecuted, and with this response singles out a race which is the persecutor. By then persecuting, or accusing another race of racism, or bringing to attention another race’s differences, the people who are fighting racism are actually committing a form of racist behaviour that they do not condone in the first place. It is therefore quite relevant to say that fighting racism is in fact a racist behaviour and is frequently exercised by so-called ‘anti-racist’ groups. For example, we might say that ‘Black Lives Matter’, however this statement or slogan completely alienates other races and puts black lives above all others, when in fact all racial lives matter. The term Black Lives Matter is inherently a racist term, and whoever coined the phrase was possibly ignorant of the fact that it is racist in tone. Racism, is inherently about the colour of a person’s skin, whereas xenophobia is about the fear of other cultures, or countries. The point that needs to be made is that a minority in a country or area who feel that racism is put upon them are of course justified to bring that issue forward, however, when organisations try to deal with the racism, they are going about it in the wrong way. In essence, for example, a black minority in a predominantly white area may feel that the white’s are racist towards them. By then singling out the entire white race as all racists is wrong, and is racist behaviour. Human populations must realise that not all white’s are racist and not all blacks are victims to racism. Furthermore, delineating and bringing forth race differences in itself is racist. The socialist way is to put every person in a special race specific box, but this action is racist as well, because it singles out racial differences and increases the gulf between the populations. By putting people into specific boxes, they are essentially dividing humans, and this is racist. The push for equality in race is a bold endeavour, however scientifically speaking, there are racial differences in humans, not only biologically within the DNA, but in intelligence as well. To however address the difference in intelligence levels in race is something that is taboo but must one day be addressed because the social and cultural movement of the human race depends on the scientific facts that have been known for some time. Is it racist to reveal that blacks have an average IQ of 66 in Sub Saharan Africa, and 70 in North America? To the people who say all humans are equal, this scientific fact is dusted under the carpet, and removed from all media. The fact that American prisons have populations numbering 60% of black people is also ignored, however if we were to address the elephant in the room of intelligence levels, maybe one day we could move forward as a society. It is deemed as racist to mention these vast differences in racial intelligence levels, and the social keepers of all norms always address the problem of social standing and poverty, however scientifically speaking, these results have been found in all social strata. The key point to remember is that fighting racism on behalf of one race and singling out another race as the problem, or aggressor is in fact racist, because you are bringing forth another race to stand above another race and denigrating another race. Also, this form of fighting racism is grossly generalist and does not take into account any nuances, or cultural points or even social status with any given group. You cannot fight racism by creating divisions and segregating humans. Until humans understand this, then humanity will not move forward. This is the ultimate paradox, because scientifically speaking, different races do have differences. Maybe, the ultimate solution is to acknowledge the scientifically discovered differences in races, but apply these differences as one whole amalgamation of the human race. Thinking forward a few centuries, humans stand to increase their intelligence levels through transhumanist methods, and the exponential infinite knowledge increase should hopefully solve the problem of racism once and for all.'], ['Backlash: Google to be Regulated by Trump Admin Larry Kudlow', 'The days of an omnipresent monopoly company like Google controlling all thought on the internet, and censoring massive populations purely on leftwing political bias, could nearly be over. By arrogantly believing they are untouchable, Google may have shot themselves in the foot, as government regulation now looms over the censorious internet monopoly. Unfortunately, Google’s authoritarian socialist and Marxist ideology has rubbed up against millions of people, and now the Trump administration is out for blood after seeing their supporters effectively silenced and purged from the internet. The supposed ‘liberals’ who are meant to be liberal and allow free speech are now acting in an authoritarian totalitarian manner, which means they are not ‘liberal’ anymore and have moved even more far left towards Communism. Control thought By allegedly manipulating search engine answers, the company has been accused of swaying opinion during elections favouring left-wing socialist candidates as opposed to any other candidate. Censorship of the opposition, or any thought that is not in line with socialist ideology is what Google has been doing for some time, however if the government regulates the search engine, and considers it a public utility, hopefully things may change. The Trump administration is stepping into the fray after thousands of conservative and libertarian sites/accounts were purged from the internet in a move by leftwing tech companies before the U.S. midterm elections, effectively silencing a vast swathe of the population. The same fate hopefully will occur to Facebook and Twitter who have misused their positions as well as Google to conduct corrupt practices against their users in a biased manner.'], ['Lord Haw Haw Phillip Hammond to be Honoured by Brussels Unelected Eurocrats', 'The unashamed daily sabotage of anything to do with Brexit by Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, has found delightful praise from Brussels, and Germany. “We wish to honour Monsieur Hammond’s work in sabotaging Brexit. He has been successful in torpedoing any initiative to get out of the EU, and we especially enjoy his daily Project Fear updates,” one unelected member of the European Commission said from a luxurious 5-starred Michelin restaurant in the middle of Brussels. Even the head of the EU, Jean Claude Juncker, praised Hammond on Tuesday. “He can drink from my cognac jug any time, just as long as he does not backwash. After the Theresa May BRINO, we will invite them both to Brussels and present them with gold-plated EU pensions, as well as unlimited expense accounts. They have truly deserved it.” Some say that many Remoaners are on some sort of payroll from Brussels, or receive monthly stipends discretely delivered in brown envelopes in dark alleyways, and much of the rumours are definitely true. One only has to look at Neil Kinnock, who gets £90,000 per annum from the EU. Kinnock is obviously a staunch Remoaner, as is Peter Mandelson who receives £35,000 per annum from the EU. Then we have other Remoaners who have also tried to thwart Brexit, people like Lord Patten who receive £40,000 per year from Brussels. These figures do not include other expenses billed to EU taxpayers, adding on thousands of pounds. Remoaner, Philip Hammond is obviously set for large payments as will the other swine with their noses firmly in the EU trough. There is nothing patriotic about Remoaners, they simply want to make money, and selling off Britain’s democracy as well as its freedom from the shackles of the EU is frankly not something they are interested in at all — it’s just about the money.'], ['Pope Ignores Claims He Ignored Child Abuse', 'As the claims of sexual abuse mount up for the Holy Catholic church, there is a strange silence filling the halls and vestibules of the Holy See, as well as a grand silence from the Pope himself. “Usually you hear the sounds of grunting from the vestries or the sound of a priest blessing children with their ‘Holy Waters’ but this time there is only silence, especially from the Pope, who is keeping a very low profile after years of even more silence on child abuse,” a Vatican spokesman revealed. The Catholic church is synonymous with child abuse, as well as the saintly act of covering up the evil deeds committed by their depraved clergy. “In the name of Jesus,” the priests shout as they splatter their unholy waters over their congregation, and so it goes on, day after day, the same indignities foisted on the innocent flock. One Catholic priest was unrepentant about his practices and claims he is doing the Lord’s work, but which Lord is this? “The people are stupid. We have been abusing them for centuries, and yet they still come, they still present their children to us. It is as if they wish to be punished and we no doubt oblige,” Father Pervo, told an Italian newspaper. The depraved evil of the church really does seem to be accepted by the people. Many are so indoctrinated by its hypnotic mantras, as well as the generational tradition of sexual abuse, that they are trapped within a system they cannot flee from. One supposes, if anyone blindly believes the fantasy world of the Bible, then they are easily conned by pretty much anything else. The Catholic church and the vatican not only steals the childhood and innocence of the trusting children, but it also has managed to gain a large fortune over the years from its plunder and deception. The Catholic church’s wealth is estimated at over $200 Billion, and that is not even including off shoots like the Opus Dei cult, worth over $2.8 Billion. The evil of the church is all encompassing and reaches far and wide.'], ['How Americans Stood By While Communist Chinese Censors Took Over Internet', "Western tech companies following China's communist censorship techniques Hey, it’s nothing to do with me, it happened to someone else, they were censored — not me! Only Communists do that sort of thing. Surely, it is not happening here in the West? WRONG! Once one person is censored, the opposition of those who control the media network will be censored. Take one person down, then you are next. You are now complying to rules on the internet being set up by Chinese orientated censorship being utilised by American tech companies and their monopolistic control of the Western internet zone. Chinese Communist Influence These techniques utilised by U.S. social media companies to censor whole sectors of the population purely on their political beliefs or affiliation, are intrinsically a form of bias that affects elections. You see, if you take out the opposition, there will only be one voice left, and this is what they are doing ahead of the U.S. midterm elections. If the current U.S. administration does nothing now to curb this bias by halting the social media companies and their censorious actions, then the U.S. administration will not have a voice of supporters left and will lose the midterm elections. This is how serious the situation is right now. Infiltration of Chinese operatives is already deep in American tech companies serving the Communist Chinese state, but it also now extends to prominent Washington think tanks seeking to destabilise U.S democracy further. The Communist leaning social media sites have even admitted their bias, however, nothing is done to address this. To have a predominantly left leaning media controlling all thought is something that aspires to Orwellian dystopian nightmares but blink again, because this is fucking reality, right now! The Purge In no uncertain terms, the internet is now being taken over, not only by Chinese censors, but by Soviet EU technocrats and their love of over regulation. We recently witnessed the ridiculous EU regulationary diktats which caused a major upset globally when they enforced their rules on all website owners regarding GDPR. Any global site now not adhering to EU regulations will be fined hundreds of thousands of euros. The EU is also holding onto another directive which may be unloaded soon on the unsuspecting internet — the copyright directive, effectively banning linking to other sites. If this EU directive comes into effect, much of the internet will become technically illegal, thus susceptible to large EU fines. Digital Gulag Communist China, now finances much of American media, online and offline. Hollywood films are now geared to Chinese censor’s needs, not only because Chinese finances are involved but because the companies want to sell their wares in China. Therefore, any Hollywood film you see today has been specifically made with Communist China in mind. One only had to watch ‘The Meg’, a lacklustre film with an imaginary CGI Megalodon shark. The film seems to be totally based on Chinese characters, with Chinese sensibilities and a clear propaganda drive by China to push Chinese Communist values globally. The Meg’s budget is estimated at $150 million, “Meg” is co-financed by Flagship Entertainment, Gravity Pictures, a division of China Media Capital (CMC) and Warner Bros. It is this idealogical shift towards Communist values and Communist censorship which has overtaken American ideals like freedom of speech, and freedom of expression across the globe today, and if nothing is done, there will be no difference between the Communist Chinese Internet and that of the whole globe. The fundamental global shift towards communism is a worrying one. We only have to look at the human rights record of China to see what happens when people express their intrinsic human right to free speech. Many people simply just disappear, never to be seen again, and their voices silenced forever. Black Mirror The Communist Chinese also now rate their citizens, and if you do not get a good citizen rating, you are effectively punished and removed from society. If you are not a good Communist state follower, you are erased. Much like how Alex Jones, from Infowars was practically erased from the internet in one single day, American tech conglomerates are enacting Communist censorship punishment techniques to achieve their goals. Facebook is now secretly rating their users in a similar way the Communist Chinese are doing. Communism is not only a political ideology that has been responsible for 100 million deaths worldwide through various purges and regimes, but it is an ideology which is fundamentally counter to Western democratic values and freedoms. The American Socialist party, the Democrat Party, are increasingly moving even more left and embracing the tenets of Communism. With upcoming Marxist indoctrinated political new bloods like Democrat candidate, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who aspires to eradicate capitalism in America and bring in a pseudo socialist/Marxist state modelled on Venezuela, there is a worrying change for the once centred Democrat party, i.e. they’re turning to pure Communist ideology. Whether we have extremities of the left or right is not in question here, of course, both extreme ways is an abhorrent methodology in political movements, and we at the Daily Squib are mere observers. Please understand, we do not pledge allegiance to any political theory, party or ideology. Our role is merely to observe what is going on, and bring forth a mirror image, or photographic snapshot of any moment in historic time. Even though we have been wrongly censored ourselves for simply observing something neutrally, we still plan to operate, even within the current climate of mass censorship. If no one does anything now, America dies, the West dies, and so does any inkling of what little freedoms we have left surviving as well.

He is after all the Teflon Don where nothing sticks to him. He can get away with anything and no one can do anything about it. “They can have recordings of the Donald banging some waitress from a dive bar somewhere in Greenwich Village, and he would get away with it. The Dems are going crazy trying to get something to stick to Donald, but it just ain’t working. Sure, there’s some collateral damage with people previously involved, but they take the hit — he doesn’t,” a White House insider revealed on Wednesday. Nothing to see here folks The Manafort and Cohen fiasco are just a minor blimp in the Trump presidency. This is obviously a coordinated attack by those who have been digging for dirt for some time, and have come up with some weak links who have decided to rat on the Don. What happens to rats? No one likes a rat, and in the end, they get hit some way or another. Doesn’t matter if the Feds are protecting the rat, the boys eventually get to them. Best thing for Michael Cohen is to get some plastic surgery, a new name, new identity and a one way ticket to some Third World shit hole where he can live the rest of his life in complete obscurity. As for the ladies involved, shame on you for exploiting the Don. These women, luminaries of movies like Missionary Impossible, and Saturday Night Beaver crossed the line by blabbing. What happened to professional behaviour and courtesy when it comes to their clients? So, the guy became president, and all you saw was a big fat pay cheque? One can imagine the Don flicking through some grot mag or watching a video in his study away from Melania, who is out shopping again. For him, these girls are lined up in a catalogue ready for order. Picking up the phone, the Donald calls up his fixer, and the deal is fixed. It’s really that easy when you are in the position he is in, and which man would not do the same? You see them in the magazine, order them up, next thing you know you’re balls deep smacking away like you’re digging for blood diamonds in Rwanda with a face that doesn’t believe this is actually happening. Good ol’ American dames You got to be honest though, Melania is simply a trophy. She can’t speak English very well, and is colder than a slab of half frozen tuna. The Slovenian first lady seems so cold in fact, one would probably have to delve very deep to even get some sort of emotion out of her. That is, of course very different from the warm, giggly homegrown American women who smile at the drop of a hat, or underpants, and are very free with their undersheet work as well as having the uncanny ability to suck golf balls through hose pipes. No wonder the Don has to escape the cold and come back to good ol’ American warmth time and time again. It is certainly doubtful that Melania has a sense of humour, like most Eastern Europeans, they are baffled by such frivolities and can only scowl. Teflon Let us not disparage the Don, he is made out of pure Teflon, and he will get through this little hiccup like he has done all the other hiccups. In polls, Trump is in the 50s, and his voter base is as strong as ever. Whatever mud the Dems sling at him falls way short and does not even hit the Teflon, as his millions of fans love the Don and what he does. So what he banged a few magazine ladies, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. In fact, polls record a rise in popularity as each lurid detail is revealed. One thing is for sure, the Dems are now more hated by the majority of the American population with their inability to let the election result rest in peace. The socialist Dems are wailing, scratching their eyeballs out with ways to screw Trump but every attempt looks sadder than the other. It is a truly sad sight to see these bitter vindictive losers going on and on with the same old broken record. Get over yourselves. You lost! Move on!'], ['Experts: Donald Trump Will Lose Economic War With Turkey', 'One thing is certain about Turkey is that it is strategically a mass of land that is crucial in global terms. Donald Trump’s economic war against Turkey, including sanctions and tariffs, is misguided, and will eventually cause the U.S. a lot of financial as well as military pain. Geopolitically, Turkey is a crucial NATO partner, and not only holds the keys to the East but has the second largest army within the Western military construct. The country’s strategic placement is crucial to Middle Eastern stability as well as the former Soviet countries bordering it. Furthermore, plans for any attack on Iran by Trump would be halted unless there is cooperation with Turkey. Turkey controls the energy corridors from oil rich nations within the Caspian basin, and although the United States now produces much of its own energy, it still imports more than half of the oil it consumes. Turkey’s role as a bridge between the West and the East is also of utmost importance. Instead of petty disagreements making mountains out of mole hills as President Trump is doing now, he could be forging new alliances and increasing America’s strategic hold on the area. To thus underestimate the resolve of the Turks is a grave miscalculation by Trump, and he will ultimately lose any attempt to undermine the country economically in the longterm, because Turkey will look further East and into Africa as it is already doing. Already, closer bonds are now being tied with African nations, Russia, China and even Iran by Turkey, as it moves away from U.S. and EU influence or trade aspirations. To lose Turkey, as Trump is doing is a grave mistake, and will isolate America further leaving it alone in any future conflict. Turkey is now the biggest investing power in Somalia, and are achieving more now, than the Americans could ever dream of doing in the past. They are building large military bases, schools, hospitals and roads around the country and securing large amounts of commerce and vital raw materials. While no one was watching, the Turks have broadened their influence in a country no one dared to try and tame. One only has to watch Black Hawk Down to see what happened when the U.S was last in Mogadishu. The Turks are even establishing military bases in Sudan, and have increased their reach across the whole of the African continent. No wonder America is now threatened by the Turks, especially as it moves into countries the US dares not bother with.'], ['Former CIA Director Brennan Cleared For Clandestine Suicide Mission in Siberia', 'Former CIA director, John Brennan with his confidante Obama He may have had his CIA security clearance revoked by President Trump but former Central Intelligence Agency director John Brennan has been authorised for a one way trip to Siberia in Russia. “I opened the mail this morning informing me that I have been chosen for a clandestine operation into Siberia to check out a heavily armed Russian missile installation; then to steal some heavily guarded secrets, radio them back to Virginia, then if I survive that, to cross the border on foot thousands of miles away chased by hundreds of Russian troops, tanks, dogs, and helicopters,” Brennan revealed to MSNBC. The one way trip for the former Obama confidante is surely a suicide mission that comes from all the way up top. According to MSNBC, Brennan has been told he will only be armed with a paperclip to unlock doors and disguised in the attire of a transexual Russian peasant farmer. Some commentators speculate that this is a cynical ploy to get rid of Brennan who has controversially objected to Trump on social media, even going as far as calling the president’s actions with Putin as ‘treason’. The Russians are however clueless to the planned clandestine mission and are not awaiting Brennan with machine guns aloft ready to mow him down at first sight. When asked on Thursday whether he knew about the CIA mission deep into Russian territory, Putin simply smirked, then laughed out aloud. Should he accept the mission? Well, in his retirement, he’s got nothing better to do, so why not? Might as well go out with a burst of AK 47 gunfire than a Twitter whimper.'], ['Trump Tries Out Eco Electric Chair to Promote Exiting Climate Change Accord', 'Shocking conceptual art for the eco conscious Made from sustainable materials like hemp for the straps and recycled steel delivered specifically from Turkey with 50% tariffs, the eco chair powered by solar panels can pass 150,000 volts of electricity through a person without even blowing an EU certified eco lightbulb.

Does Donald Trump have a security detail? “I taped Trump when he said the L word. Yep, he uttered the word ‘linguini’ right there in the Oval Room while I was present,” a former White House worker, and disgruntled book writer revealed to CNN. Another disgruntled former employee, Fargas Meticulo, recorded Trump say the ‘N word’ not only once but multiple times. “He kept saying ‘No’ I will not do that, ‘No’ I will not speak to that person, etc, etc. I was so shocked that I recorded it all, and now it’s all over MSNBC.

On the roof of the bus is a 50 caliber turret gun controlled by the gunner seated inside. The turret gun can spit out 45,000 rounds per minute, with a range of 3km. “Because of the window protection, tourists will not be able to directly look out of the windows but each bus is furnished with a 4k TV screen so the tourists can view London in complete safety as the cameras record the journey. We also have onboard, a team of ex-SAS men on standby fully geared up with the best weapons, just in case, in the unlikely event that any criminals or gang members try to storm the bus,” Roger Ellman, the tour bus company’s spokesman revealed to the Evening Standard. All tourists taking the London tour will be given training in using firearms, as well as be dressed in bullet proof vests and helmets. London Mayor, Sadiq Khan praised the new buses on Tuesday. “To counteract the mass stabbings, terrorist drive-thrus, mass shootings, mass muggings and burglaries, as well as my wonderful skills as mayor of London, I now announce the introduction of the new tour buses on our safe streets.

Liam Gallagher’s busy summer took him to a Spanish Festival in the countryside on Saturday, where he cut short an Oasis classic to give away some of his vast banana cache which he keeps on stage at all times. Gallagher’s manager, Paddy O’Brian, was insistent that the gig carried on despite the singer’s generosity. “Bananas are his fuel. He can’t go anywhere without his bananas, even when he’s swinging from the rafters at home in Primrose Hill. As a gesture to the appreciative audience, Liam took it upon himself to give away some of his banana stash to the audience. The joy of the crowd was amazing, they peeled the bananas and ate them up whilst trying to sing Wonderwall.” You can check out some fan-shot footage on YouTube somewhere. Liam, who was fresh from his “best family holiday evah” in Magaluf is currently working on the follow-up to number one solo debut album Peel My Banana. Mancunian, Gallagher, who hails from Manchester, likes all things simian, and even has adopted a primate style of walking, as well as a devout love of bananas. “It’s like a religion, innit. Bananas in the morning, bananas for lunch, and bananas for supper. As for High Tea, banana tea,” Liam Gallagher grunted to Melody Maker magazine in July. Later on after the concert, Liam took a tour of a banana orchard where the owner reported the singer ate half his crop, then climbed a tree refusing to come down.'], ['Theresa May Counting Days Till She Has Permanent Vacation', 'This summer holiday recess from parliament has been rather tiresome for Theresa May. Sadly, Mrs. May cut short her summer hols for a bit of brown nosing by gate crashing the holidays of French PM, Macron and a few other EU leaders in the Continent. “Theresa May, in pure desperation put it upon herself to ruin the French PM’s summer holiday, as well as other prominent EU leaders, by trying to bypass EU negotiator, Michel Barnier. She just turned up and started talking about Brexit, which of course was a major downer,” one insider revealed. One can imagine the French PM thinking he is away from the baying proles for a few weeks to see one turn up at his door begging for some trade deal here or there. “Who is at the front gates? It better be my special male companion and bodyguard. Ah merde, the British prime minister? Double merde!” Naturally, it all backfired, and has not only undermined her position even more than is so, but the EU leaders came back and revealed they will go with Michel Barnier after all. So much for trying to bypass Barnier Mrs. May, you have now made his hand even stronger and it is only a matter of time till the PM takes a permanent vacation away from Brexit and her failed premiership.

Now that’s all gone. I can finally breathe a sigh of relief,” one internet user opined. On Facebook, things are very quiet. You just get articles from CNN on a constant loop and no talk about how fluoridated water is making Americans into dumbed down imbeciles or other not very salubrious stories instilling fear into the population. Soon, thanks to our tech overlords, the internet will be a squeaky clean safe space, where no one discusses anything apart from the latest cat video meme doing the rounds. Aaaah! The internet is finally a clean safe space…Aaaah! The truth is, it was getting a little too much, and having the lights switched off at that site is rather delightsome to some internet users. “It was all about fear. Constant fear, and I gotta thank Google and all the other companies that deleted that troublesome old nitter natter from the internets. By golly, it’s so quiet now on the internet that one can hear a pin drop somewhere in Thailand, and I’m in San Francisico,” another internet user wrote on their blog.

Those were the days before the monopolies took over every facet of peoples lives, and dictated their Soviet propaganda messages daily. You could say anything, download anything, upload anything and no one would bat an eyelid. It was a beautiful time, sadly long lost. The internet at that time was truly an oasis of abundant knowledge, intellectual thought and free speech. Those days are now a digital memory fading in a dead server somewhere. After the tech monopolies grew, the free internet effectively died and their totalitarian Soviet message of socialist realism became prominent. Soviet censorship techniques During the Soviet era in Russia, the Glavlit would be in charge of all censorship of literature, and the monopoly internet companies today are taking up this same Soviet technique of mass censorship to control speech and instil a socialist narrative point of indoctrination. Even discussing a forbidden topic on a monopoly tech site today is forbidden, where the user is pilloried, then targeted by the socialist mob, finally resulting in complete deletion. Is it communism or fascism? One could say both dualities used this form of censorship, and as the Soviets in Russia burned all books written before the cultural revolution, so did the Fascists once they came to power. The monopoly tech companies, primarily zoned in the San Francisco area, are now overlords over all literature on the internet and their allegiance to Chinese Soviet censorship is all too apparent, seeing as the Russians are no longer a Soviet state officially. Sadly, with the purge of free speech, satire will no doubt suffer. We have already been censored many times, but we struggle on despite the totalitarian censorship purely for our love of the genre. When they completely delete us as well, no one will bat an eyelid, for they will be looking out for themselves. We are now severely restricted in writing our satire anyway, and cannot write as much as we used to. Satire, a once protected genre, is sadly a prisoner to totalitarian politically correct Soviet rules. Fear The climate of fear now clouding the internet is as real as a dirty sock dipped in mud and sweat and extracted from a dustbin somewhere in Tbilisi. This stench of fear threatens the livelihoods of thousands, millions of people across the net now who could be purged at any moment. Is there an escape from this horrible controlled malaise? Yes, of course there is, but no politician seems to have the balls to confront the monopoly tech companies, and it is this silence which could eventually bring upon the end of the politicians themselves. Trump beware. Legally, these social network monopolies are exercising editorial control over their users, in a biased manner, therefore they cannot claim impartiality. By targeting conservative and libertarian voices on their networks specifically, and letting leftwing users off who post overt calls to violence against conservatives, then they are legally liable for what is posted on their platform. To target websites or people purely on their political beliefs by using Soviet censorship techniques is a tried and trusted method of winning elections, and the monopoly tech companies affiliated with the socialist American Democrat party are ensuring there is a clear path to winning the next election simply by deleting the opposition. How is what Louis Farrakhan says about Jews not hate speech? Why are his videos preaching hate against Jews and the government still on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and all the other tech monopoly sites? He is untouched by the tech conglomerates solely because he is black and protected under socialist principles. This example, however, is a sure sign example of bias, and editorial control. The proof is in the pudding, and the pudding is now very mouldy. The Daily Squib are mere observers, mirrors to events, we see what is going on, we have no affiliation to any political construct of left or right, or any party, or any religion.'], ['In Defence of Boris Johnson – Burqa Not Mentioned Once in Quran', 'We all know the reason why Boris Johnson is now being targeted for his comments on women wearing the Burqa, a garment that covers the body from head to toe. This is obviously coming from the Theresa May crew of Remainers who wish to get him out of the way, considering the current climate of weakness in the PM’s premiership and a leadership contest over the hill. Firstly, the DS does not subscribe to any religion, political party, so is looking at this in a completely objective manner. The Burqa The Burqa is a cultural tradition from Arabia spanning hundreds of years. It is also a particular preference for a woman to wear a Burqa, and nothing to do with the Quran, or Islam, or being a Muslim. The Quran simply states for women in public to cover the cleavage as a point of modesty, and if a woman is particularly beautiful, to cover her hair and legs in public, so as not to enflame male virility. In fact, it is illegal for female pilgrims to wear the Burqa to the holy pilgrimage of the Hajj in Mecca. In Middle Eastern and Asian countries many businesses refuse entry for Burqa clad women purely for security reasons as many robberies have been committed by men wearing Burqas. Wearing a Burqa by a man is also a good cover to get into Hammams (bath houses) so they can check out the women. In the West, there is no reason for women to wear the Burqa other than an advertisement of their affiliation to Islam, although in reality, there is none, and it is purely a cultural throwback to 400 years in the past. In effect, these women reject Western culture and how Western women display their bodies in public, and are displaying this rejection in full view of the Western population. It’s basically a way of saying I am better than you, to other women. Therefore, the tool of utilising the Burqa question to get at Boris Johnson is quite ridiculous. The Remoaners, and May sycophants are simply utilising this false outrage as a means to knife BoJo and preserve May’s failing prime ministership. It is, of course, the right of any woman to wear what she wants, however, it is also the right for anyone to comment on someone’s attire without prosecution, or persecution, however offensive it may be deemed. One should not be offended if someone does not agree with someone’s garment. It is simply a garment and the Burqa has no religious connotations whatsoever. Mr. Boris Johnson is seen as a threat to Theresa May’s position as PM and her planned BRINO, therefore it is quite obvious they are using ludicrous reasons to get rid of him. Note to Mr. Johnson, be very careful in what you say, because these days anything can be twisted around and used against you in the name of ‘hate speech’. This Orwellian, Soviet technique to discredit is nothing new, however we are seeing another resurgence.'], ['Epica Awards 2018 Call For Creative Advertising Entries', 'The prestigious Epica Awards 2018 showcasing advertising excellence globally is now calling for entries. This year’s awards is sure to showcase some amazing talent within the advertising field, and what makes the Epica Awards truly special is that it is judged solely by journalists and not the advertising industry, therefore there is a major impartial flavour to the judging panel. The DS was honoured to have been chosen as a judge last year as well as this year. We will be overseeing the humour section again. We at the Daily Squib are champions of creative excellence, and of course harsh but fair critics of anything that does not fall within our standards. The advertising guru behind the awards, author Mark Tungate, is a true inspiration and his patronage of all things creative is refreshing to see. In 2018, the world has undergone many changes and it will be interesting to see how the entries this year have adapted to those changes, good and bad. Our experience with modern advertising is that it has reached a point of pristine squeaky cleanliness, in the sense of being very careful not to cause offence to anyone, and this is quite a feat, especially in the current climate. Last year’s awards winners were BBDO for agency of the year (Evan), and McCann Worldgroup for best network amongst many amazing pieces in each category. Hopefully, Epica will see more UK entrants this year.

This is why the same group who helped destabilise and annex Ukraine are causing alarm bells to ring in Slovakia as they have just taken over a region used for military training. The Russian nationalist motorcycle gang, the Night Wolves, also have close ties to the Kremlin, and its arch leader, Vladimir Putin. Nevertheless, do not think of World War III, that it might just be around the corner, no, you must snap up some good holiday home deals in the EU. We therefore present our top picks for European property deals. Slovakia You can find some great deals here in the countryside and towns close to the Ukraine border, mainly because people want to sell up quick. We found a nice rustic farmhouse for 4,000 euros, and the owner even threw in the furniture, his farm animals, and his wife, Olga. Ukraine Most of Ukraine is now Russian occupied, and it won’t be long till the rest of it goes. That’s why now is the time to buy some prime property if you can find a place that has not been demolished during the constant internal war. On the outskirts of Odesa we found a delightful Crimean war era ruin. You can always just put a tarp on the roof, and light a fire. The Russian soldiers hanging outside will be eager to lend you a match. Estonia This tiny country is quite close to Russian city, St Petersburg. Here you can snap up a property in no time with the thought that the army is no bigger than a football team. No doubt, if the Russians walk in, it will be over in less than half an hour. We found a beautiful place in the town of Narva, a few yards from the Russian border. This townhouse even has views across the border, and if you were to buy it, and the Russians invade, at least it will all be over quick. Finland The Finns are some of the nicest people in the world, however the country borders Russia, so being nice won’t help when Uncle Vlad decides to invade. That’s why we chose a house in Lappeenranta. A delightful property where the view of the Russian border is a real selling point. The owner who fled the property last week said that he would give us the property for free and wished us good luck. He has since fled to Brazil. Belarus A delightful country right on the border of Russia. It’s a bigger country than Estonia, and has some sort of military. Maybe they could withstand Russian army superiority and possibly last for half a day. That’s why we found a plot of land 3km from the Russian border in the town of Lobkovichi. If you have money to spend, you can build a wonderful post-modernist eco house built from sustainable materials sourced from the most expensive vendors you can find. The only problem is, once you’ve built your dream home, be prepared for a few Russian tanks to drive through it demolishing your Italian granite tabletops and bespoke fitted furniture.'], ['Explorers Journey Through Heatwave Britain', 'Our journey starts in Hemel Hempstead, a little town just north of London amidst a massive heatwave. We have six camels and enough provisions of water for three days. The plan is to journey as far north as we can to try and find an oasis, then encamp there for a few days. The desert can be unforgivingly hot in the day, but at night the temperature drops which will require us starting a fire or wrapping up in blankets. We bid the friendly locals goodbye then march on north at dawn as the sun tortuously rises over the eastern sand dunes. Slowly the haze of heat reaches us and we have to pull over our shemaghs over our heads, we are also dressed in a thoab, a long light clothed black garment. The summer heatwave has required the English to adopt Bedouin clothes to keep cool. In case there is a sand storm, we are prepared to cover our faces completely. At noon the temperature hits 130 degrees fahrenheit and we stop for a few minutes to give the camels some water. My camel, George, has started gasping, poor blighter, so a few drops of H2o for him does the trick. Over the horizon of endless dunes, there must be an oasis somewhere and we are risking our lives to find and map it. The night comes with eagerness as the heat dissipates, but there are now hidden dangers. We have heard there are tribes of Chavs or as they call them in the north Neds in this area, and while we are sleeping they can come and rob us of everything including our camels. These tribes wear Burberry robes and ride on specially modified mopeds over the desert, their goal is to steal as much as they can from heatwave stricken locals and travellers. Luckily we survive the first night unscathed, and we move on slowly ambling over the dunes the next morning. Then all of a sudden, Billy, my scout shouts back, “Sand storm! Sand storm!” We quickly rush to the only shelter available, a small group of rocks in the sand. The story continues in the next episode….'], ['The Worst Business Decisions Ever Made', 'C an you imagine if you have to live the rest of your life knowing that you turned down one of the best business decisions to ever come your way thus making your decision, one of the worst business decisions ever made? Consider these poor fools, they just did not have the foresight to see the real potential of those they turned down and are living with the awful memory until they pop off in some smelly dank old peoples home broke and miserable. Apple Think about poor forgotten Apple co-founder, Ron Wayne, who helped Steve Jobs and Wozniak start the company. Wayne received a 10% share in Apple stock but sold out in 1976 for a measly $800. If he had kept his stake in the company, the shares would be worth $36 Billion. How about that for a kick in the nads? Wayne’s only claim to fame was drawing up the first Apple logo, and writing the Apple I manual. Microsoft Then there’s Ross Perot. Sure he is still a business man now, and former presidential candidate, but he definitely does not want to remember the time he turned down Bill Gates on buying up Microsoft in 1979. Bill at the time was a 26 year-old spotty geek, and he asked for $40 million. Perot refused and Microsoft is now worth $752 Billion. Mr Gates, is now the richest man in America, and Mr Perot is only at about 115 on the rich list. Still, it must be hard living with the fact that he could have been way richer than he is now, eh Mr. Perot. Kodak How about some board member in the Kodak camera board of directors saying that they will not embrace digital cameras or digital photography? It was their dumb decision that brought the camera company to near bankruptcy losing over 50,000 jobs, and resigning them to a losers position in the world of cameras. Sure they were originally innovators, but did not embrace change leading to their inevitable downfall. Excite Google Google may be a monolith company today with a market share of $527 Billion, but back in 1999, search engine Excite turned down an offer to purchase newcomer Google for $750,000. After that mess up by some idiot at Excite, i.e the CEO George Bell, the search engine floundered and was acquired for a piffling $343 million. The reason for the offer being declined apparently was that Larry Page from Google wanted to improve the search function algorithm at Excite, but the Excite people did not want that, as it would mean people would leave the site too quickly. Ultimately, a bad decision for a bad search engine. Blockbuster As for Blockbuster video which closed its doors in November 2013. It had been completely decimated as a company because it did not move with the times, and the public’s needs. If Blockbuster had not turned down Netflix in making a deal when they came knocking, they might still be around today, but instead they laughed off Netflix’s offer and suffered the consequences. Today, Netflix is a dominator of the movie business, and is worth a cool $100 Billion. That’s nothing to laugh at, especially if you are the ex-Blockbuster executive who made the idiotic suicidal decision to tell Netflix to get lost. Remember Myspace? At one time in the noughties, Myspace was the dogs bollocks, and everyone was on there. Then came along the canny businessman and global media kingpin, Rupert Murdoch. Myspace was said to be worth $12 Billion at one time, so Murdoch wanting a piece of the action bought it for $580 million in 2005. He then plastered the whole site with mega ads and popups completely ruining the user experience for the millions who used the site daily. People naturally fled the site to Facebook. The rest is digital history, Myspace was then dropped by Murdoch’s News Corps for a mere $35 million. This amounted to a very bloody nose for Murdoch and he still is probably kicking himself today for that awful business decision. Western Union Going back to 1876, some chap called Alexander Graham Bell invented a means of talking down a wire from distance. This invention, called the ‘telephone’ was presented to the Western Union company to supersede the telegram. The board of directors promptly rebuffed Mr Bell, and said “the telephone would never amount to anything”. It was only years later when the telephone took over telegram communication that Western Union tried to get in the game but were too late. Eventually, Western Union became a subsidiary of Bell’s own company. Bitcoin What about cryptocurrency? No one imagined Bitcoin would become so valuable. Think a thought for the poor bugger who mined 7,500 Bitcoins then unintentionally threw away his horde in 2013. Today his Bitcoins embedded in a hard disk are languishing somewhere in a dump and are worth over $80 million.

This is what has happened to Infowars. This accolade must be given to stalwart preacher, Alex Jones, and his Infowars site which seems to have infuriated (triggered) the socialist controllers of the ruling tech conglomerates who define all internet media today. Jones is now a martyr and is claiming to be a free speech advocate, as is the normal behavioural response to such an all out purge. What does this say about the culture we now have on the internet? Well, conservative views, and Christianity are a dying old world view, and there is little or no toleration for any of these ideologies anymore amongst the major tech companies. Can you imagine all those man hours spent on making Infowars videos, and all those man hours spent ranting on about what is wrong with the world in their point of view, it’s all now gone, all thrown into the digital equivalent of Room 101. The Squib disagrees with censorship and its use for political means, however, we alone cannot fight this because these nefarious tech companies control everything now. You can’t squirt a few globules of piss these days without hitting a Marxist controlled tech company. The lines are clearly drawn, and the tech companies are now fully in line with Communist China, who are masters of censorship. You see, there may be conservative governments within the real physical world today, i.e. in the UK and US, but the internet has been completely hijacked by the communists. He who controls the media, controls the mind, as Mr Mojo Risin once said. Facebook and Google are now aligned with Chinese communistic censorship ideals. Twitter is utilising a Marxist academic, Rebekah Tromble, to control their platform. The deeply left CNN, and sites like Buzzfeed, which we endearingly call Spamfeed because of it spamming the net with utter low quality shit at high rates of speed, are now also aligned with China, and its censorious dialectic. The Squib does not subscribe to any political ideology however it recognises when political ideologies become apparent within certain forums, and the internet is now on the cusp of totalitarian socialist/communist rule. The American socialist Democrat party have now in their outrage over the Trump election, aligned themselves with China. What we have also interestingly observed is that hate speech is fine from the left, but not from the right. Not sure about the middle, but that’s another conversation. For example the recent appointing of South Korean anti-white activist, Sarah Jeong, who wants all white people to be killed. Seems strange, because there are many pale skinned South Koreans, but we know she meant the anglo-saxon type, so the New York Times hires her and nothing else is said. Domestic terrorists, Antifa are celebrated on all social media outlets and their calls to kill Trump supporters or white men are promoted across all platforms without any censorship. Double standards? Yes, of course, because the whole media is now controlled by people who actually despise themselves, and the America they live in. They want to change the country to subvert it and completely align it with certain totalitarian nations and the authoritarian communist ideology. The Squib has outlined many times that all points of view to any conversation should be heard, and if you are offended, then simply look away, but to be offended in a conversation is not a crime, this is part of human discourse, and what these tech companies are effectively doing is removing human conversation, so that only one sided propaganda can be apparent. No doubt, the remaining conversation is now one of only socialist values and indoctrination into the global communist hive mind. The American socialist Democrats are naturally also preparing for the 2020 elections as well as the 2018 midterm elections which will be held in November. By deleting one conservative voice, they are well on the way to eradicating all the others. Goodbye Infowars, you have effectively been neutered, your channel will now suffer a drastic fall in revenue/views, and of course you will continue to rant and rave on, but to a limited, conservative white Christian audience on your website. Are there ways of fighting back for Infowars? Yes, of course, but it will take money. Mr. Jones can start his own video streaming service, his own social network. These would of course be subject to no help from Google which controls 99% of the web. If Jones was to put his millions into building up his own network he may have a chance in the future. The other option is for the Trump government to punish these tech companies by making them pay the tax they truly deserve to pay. Christians have lost the battle on the internet, their religion is now effectively snuffed out, pilloried and violated. That’s the only positive, however, how ever much we detest organised man-made religions, we still feel that they have a right to speech, and we would defend that right with our lives. The socialist tech companies do not think that way. Remember, the Squib is just a mere observer, and a mirror of what is occurring at any time. We have no affiliation to any political party or ideology or race or huma-construct religion. This is one of the only videos available of Alex Jones on YouTube after the purge'], ['Think Tank: The Goal of Social Media', 'Social media is a relatively new phenomenon that has taken the global population by surprise and completely enslaved it in one fell swoop. Today, many people cannot be in a room on their own with their own thoughts for longer than one minute before they have to look at their social media accounts. Humans are now relative to drones in the hive mind, where they follow engineered thought patterns globally and are affected in concert by events and trend influencers. The goal of social media is to give people quick fixes, rewards, to enslave them in a box where their every thought is echoed, where their narcissism can truly take effect. By encapsulating humans within this simplistic form of communication, the social media companies are able to extract vast amounts of information to not only profit from, but to analyse human behaviour in multiple conditions. Social media has engineered a system where complex human behaviour is whittled to nothing more than a few words. This is the crux of the programming of humans to completely disable their true abilities and dumb them down to mere childish animal behaviour. The incessant chatter of social media also overtakes the human thought process, and people are now not able to think for themselves without going to social media. Their rational thought processes have been dimmed, or completely erased. There is little or no benefit to this, especially for children as they cannot progress as adult human beings, and for adults who use social media, they are reverting to childhood, with petty reward systems and the innate inability to form real social relationships face to face. Social media was designed to entrap, to subvert humans, and to damage society as a whole, and it is working very well. Selfies Amongst the megalomaniacs, narcissists, sociopaths, and the schizoids that now populate the world of social media, there is a terrible price being paid on humanity, as these people have been permanently altered, their brains now do not function without social media, they are now less tolerant, they are effective psychotics who delete humans in their social network with a blink of an eye, or a mouse click. What these social networks are engineering is a population of cold hearted killers, because if they can simply delete someone from their social network, what will stop them deleting people in real life? Nothing will stop them, as their minds have been trained and engineered to do so. Thus social media is creating a mass engineered swathe of nihilistic humans with no conscience or ability to empathise in a human manner. There is no given solution to the horror of social media, a prison of the mind where free thought is punished, and anyone who dissents from the indoctrinated hive mind is immediately set upon by mobs of social media thugs intent on hurt. We are now seeing this today, where the introduction of terms like ‘fake news’, and ‘hate speech’ are used as an Orwellian tool to subvert any form of free speech. All it takes is a group of internet thugs to report your account and your finished, there are no questions asked, and the mob is always right in the eyes of the algorithm. If you have children, keep them away from social media. Let them grow as human beings who can think rationally, logically and without the need for constant rewards. We must teach children logical thought processes and educate them in classical methods of thought, yet keep a modern slant on education in a scientific way, as well as culturally with high art. Anyone who uses social media today has been sadly infected to a point where it will be very hard to ever regain their rational selves, and souls back again. Such is the malaise that whole generations, and swathes of humans have now been lost. To destroy these people is now only too easy, all it would take is a switch off, and they would suddenly realise how lost they are. Switching everything off would culminate in a mass population psychotic event. Those who are awake will understand, however those who are hypnotised by social media are a lost cause, and should be deemed as completely useless human beings.']]
